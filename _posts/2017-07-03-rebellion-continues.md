<em>
We fight for the liberation of the individual.  
For the conquest of life.  
For the triumph of our ideas.  
For the realization of our dreams.
And if our ideas are dangerous, it is because
we are those who love to live dangerously.  
And if our dreams are crazy, it is because we
are crazy.  
But our madness is our great
wisdom… <a href="#fn1" id="fn1a">[1]</a>
</em>

There they were, the voracious youth again,
destroying everything, erecting barricades,
clashing with police, nothing could stop
them… There is fire and passion in their
hearts, love and hatred on their insides,
courage and decision. The beauty of chaos
has returned to grace the streets, it is not
only fire that adorns the asphalt, it is also the
energy of the youth, the abolition of the
sexes, everyone in the struggle… Will this
struggle bear fruit? To want to study just to
be someone in life? The individual who goes
searching for real happiness, does not stop at
so little, she knows that she can educate
herself, and although that path is longer, that
doesn’t make it less interesting, because
everything else is interminable…

To raze the school is possible today, like it
was done in the colegio Guillermo Cruz de
Estaciòn Central, in the colegio Gabriel
Gonzales Videla, that sheltered the students
of liceo Insuco 2 from the earthquake and
also the Polytechnic of Arica; those places
intentionally lit ablaze by those beautiful
pajarillas who understand that this destruction is a great step towards the conquest of
life…

The journey is intense and difficult, it always
has been, when individuals fed up with their
miserable conditions organize and attack.
One cannot be afraid of those who organize
only for one specific goal although it is only
to destroy, because at this point we know
that to build, we must destroy… And all the
reasoning these petty politicians supposedly
have when they talk about the problem of
education, does nothing for anyone, because
the discontent grows and advances, although
the bureaucrats and businessmen almost
always end up winning. And they believe
that to repress passion is a simple thing, that
with a little tear gas and a little water they
will snuff it out, like any other flame, so they
will have to be reminded that they are
wrong, again and again, those idiots. The
night always illuminates our steps, just like
free love allows us unlimited bliss, to find us
with the beautiful silence of obscurity, or at
the feet of the fresh rays of the rising sun;
(rays which don’t caress those awkward
workers drooling over the bus windows and
subway glass), running into the heat of a
barricade, it’s magic, like something
supreme, or can only god be supreme? We burn the churches with their pedophile
priests inside, we watch those cowardly
abusers from the front to spit in their faces…
another day comes, but this is one of the
beautiful ones, because we will combine the
sun that caresses us with its heat with an
emancipatory fire full of joy and hope…

Here are the barricades again, with those
sensual forms we are drawn by the fire,
which one day happened to arrive at a La
Polar warehouse stocked with dirty merchandise. But the good guys are coming, the
firefighters, those most contemptible beings,
those infamous voyeurs, who complain
about being hit with rocks when they were
going to put out the fire, but we still
remember when they gave their ladders to
the police to evict the people of Andha Chile
who were squatting the Mapocho for a
decent living; cowards always in the service
of authority. The individual who moves
toward the greatest happiness possible, will
never stumble, her journey is unique and
without equal, there is nothing that can stop
her, not the cops in red who beat her with
sticks, not morality imposing its limits, not
the police infiltrators who dirty her path, not
the din of their sirens to silence her…

<em>“We banish those terrible mores from
ourselves completely, like evil men who for
so long have caused us harm”</em>
<a href="#fn2" id="fn2a">[2]</a>, imposing
norms, morals, discipline, gods and their
idiotic doctrines, we always forget society
and its dominions, and cast ourselves naked
into an encounter with our inner beings.

Today it is time to kill the cops in our heads,
and this, to be sure, is a great battle. It’s
much easier to throw a rock at an armored
truck and believe that, from this act, liberty
closely follows. It’s much easier to spend
hours and hours talking about revolution and
organization. It’s much easier to believe that
going to a free university will change the
world. Students, don’t be fooled, remember
that those who control the world also
attended the university, and to their disgrace,
some studied for free. And what did they
become? Heartless beings capable of torture
in their jails and murder for a few cents, and
what do you say now? That you’ll be
another? This remains to be seen…

Liberty is a vital and absolute force, this
must be what unites us, whatever other
demand will fade away with time, but if we
reach any understanding of the vitality of the
conquest of the individual’s own life, there
will be no law that can stop her, no fear that
paralyzes her, no chains that bind her, no
gods that punish her as she advances firmly
toward total emancipation! There are those
who still believe in revolution, and to them
we say that ours began long ago, at the
moment we decided to stop being sheep and
became individualist and nihilist anarchists.

So, we’re not scared to tell them that today,
social revolution is impossible, because this
society is rotten at its core, as a product of
which the individual was slowly fitted with
values and a moralism that destroys her
completely, and how? A taste of the whip
and its punishment, of a militarized education, of the opus dei of supernumerary
catholicism, and of a bourgeois Christian
democratic tradition; etc… basically, of the
system. And what’s worse, those people feel
proud to be humans and not animals, and as
though this was not enough, they enslave
and indiscriminately use the animals to
lengthen their miserable lives. Thus, we
despise humanity, simply because their
submissive and alienated behaviors that
make them modern slaves, are not within us.

In this world of sickness,
<em>“we feel alive when
we shudder with the perfume of the flowers,
with the songs of the birds, with the crashing
of the waves, the sound of the wind, the
silence of solitude”</em> <a href="#fn3" id="fn3a">[3]</a>, we feel alive when
we tremble with the heat of the fire, with the
caress of chaos, with the nights of revolt…

<em>“We rushed into the chasm, to respond to
the voices of our dead”</em> <a href="#fn4" id="fn4a">[4]</a>, they who died
fighting with weapons in their hands and
immense golden stars in their eyes, those
who are immortal like el punky Mauri, like
Claudia Lopez, who on any given night
found themselves facing death so gracefully.
Yes, because those of us who choose to live
an intense and dangerous life, death receives
us with open arms, caresses us and kisses
us… Why don’t we fear death? Because
<em>“we are used to thinking that death is nothing to
us, because everything, good and bad, resides
within sensation and death is the deprivation
of the senses. Death is nothing to us because
when we exist, death is absent and, when
death is present, then we no longer exist.”</em> <a href="#fn5" id="fn5a">[5]</a>


<em>“The wise (the fierce individual) neither
refuses life nor fears death, because to her, it
is not a burden to be alive, nor is it an evil
not to be.”</em> <a href="#fn6" id="fn6a">[6]</a> It’s true, we want everything,
we dream of huge banquets and shun bread
and tea, we want grand orgies and reject
monogamy. We believe in free love because
we know
<em>“that jealousy, and exclusive
romance, conjugal fidelity, kills off part of
the self, impoverishes sentimental personality, narrows analytical horizons, among
other things. And furthermore, in love as in
almost everything else, it is only abundance
which annihilates jealousy and envy…”</em> <a href="#fn7" id="fn7a">[7]</a>
we want to run together with the animals in
the fields and the forests, we want to bathe
naked on the beaches, rivers and lakes and
not end up at a precinct for indecency.
<em>“We reassert the right to live naked, to take
off our clothes, to wander naked, to join
together among nudists without any concern
of discovering the body’s resistance to
temperature, this is to affirm the right to the
disposition of individual corporeality…”</em> <a href="#fn8" id="fn8a">[8]</a>


If there are those who belittle our beautiful
solitude, then we propose to them free
association, instead of a society (society =
membership by force). We are egoists, but
our egoism is generous. What does this
mean? That we can give to and concern
ourselves with someone who we consider
our friend, simply because it is a chosen
emotion, unlike with comrades, because in
most situations you don’t choose them, you
simply encounter them in some global or
particular conflict and because of this you
cannot expect anything from them.

Chilean society is convulsing, it knows
there’s a conflict and doesn’t know how it
will end, there are students wounded, two
dead and a few in jail, there are others on
hunger strike, the tension increases, it’s
visible in the streets every time there’s a day
of action and protest, the confrontations
between pacifist and violent protestors keep
on increasing, so much that they have struck
and snatched the masks off of some
encapuchadxs. Careful, citizens, civil war
doesn’t frighten us… Liberatory violence is
the only way to put an end to the daily
suffering of the individual and the cruel
tragedies that scourge the humans and
animals of this earth.

Violence is only justifiable when it’s
necessary to defend oneself, or if you wish,
others from violence. The oppressed and
poor are constantly in a state of legitimate
defense, so their violence against their
exploiters and oppressors are always justified.
Besides, for two to live in peace, they have
to both want the peace; if one of the two
insists on wanting to force the other (by
hunger) to work, study, or follow their laws,
the oppressed, if they want to maintain their
dignity as individuals and not be reduced to
the most abject slavery, in spite of all their
love for peace and harmony, they will have
no choice but to resist by force with means
appropriate to the circumstances…

Any real change will necessarily be violent,
though violence on its own may be harmful.
It has to be violent because it would be
madness to hope that the privileged would
recognize the pain and injustice their
privileges cause and decide to voluntarily
renounce them. It has to be violent because
temporary revolutionary violence is the only
way to put and end to the much greater and
perpetual violence that has enslaved the large
majority of humans and animals…

Today we want to present the individualist-nihilist anarchist viewpoint of this conflict, as
well as to revive the ideas captured on paper
that some people have made tangential. Our
intention will never be to speak as authorities
or lead a flock.

We are the negation of negation, we are a
nightmare for those who seek hegemony
over anarchism or continue with the old and
rotten concept of class war, we are clear
about what we desire and believe, we’re not
interested in making a good impression on
people, for us the class war is dead, the poor
steal from the poor, in the streets the it’s the
proletariat who represses the in the insurgent
proletarian, the modern slaves who add a
link to their chains each day, who bow down
to consumerism.

What would the people do if we shut down
all their fast food joints?

What would the people do if we burned all
their stores?

What would the students do if we tore down
their schools and universities?

What would society do if they destroyed
their beloved phone and internet towers?

To summarize, what would proletarians do if
we gave them back their life? We believe
they would search for us until they found and
killed us, but what they don’t know is that
we are already dead, and sadly, the dead
cannot be killed…

The revolt is here, we must increase our
participation, our generous egoism needs to
contribute, for now, to the struggle, to
gather and organize ourselves for specific
ends such as destruction, enjoyment, loving
camaraderie, encounters with chaos,
advancing towards the dawn [or awakening]
of the creative nothing, then returning to our
hiding places, to rejoice and dance with the
birds, to nourish ourselves with the energy of
the trees, to feel the ocean breeze, to hear the
lovely melody of the wind…

We have already said it and we’ll say it
again: our revolution has already begun, we
make it from day to day, making free love,
declaring ourselves against every god and
religion, deconstructing the dominating
language that they imposed on us, openly
opposing any society, we make it when we
stop being men and women and become
unique human beings.

They complain, with reason, that individualist and nihilist anarchists don’t have a
program or offer a pseudo-revolutionary
project, nor are we interested in inserting
ourselves in any type of society. To put it
quantitatively: among boundless occupations, ours is the search for total satisfaction,
endless joy, pleasure, eternal happiness, the
individual revolution here and now. After all,
we’ll tell them: only time will tell who
achieves their goals…

<em>
It is the hour of the social tragedy!  
We will destroy, laughing.  
We will burn, laughing.  
We will kill, laughing.  
We will expropriate, laughing.   
And society will fall.  
The fatherland will fall.  
The family will fall.  
Everything will fall, since the free man has been born.  
The time to drown the enemy in blood has arrived… <a href="#fn9" id="fn9a">[9]</a>
