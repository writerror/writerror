<h4 id="toc1">Translator’s Preface</h4>

<p>
<em>Barbarians</em> by Chrissus and Odotheus is a text of some importance
for anarchists and anyone else who sincerely desires the destruction
of this social world of exploitation and domination. It presents a
devastating critique of a book that has become one of the most
significant theoretical influences on a major part of the so-called
anti-globalization movement, <em>Empire</em> by Michael Hardt and
Antonio Negri. When one reads these two texts together, two opposing
ways of using language are exposed. Hardt and Negri use a language
that is obviously meant to conceal at least as much as it reveals, and
that should immediately tip one off to the recuperative nature of
their text. Chrissus and Odotheus, on the contrary, use direct language as
sharp as a barbarian’s sword to cut through the murky web of Hardt’s
and Negri’s postmodern doublespeak to reveal the essentially
anti-revolutionary core of their perspective.
</p>

<p>
For example, Hardt and Negri claim to be post-dialectical and
post-Marxist. It merely takes a slight rip of the veil to expose a
historical determinism and a rigid dialectic of class struggle that
reflects one of the crudest versions of Marxism. Negri and Hardt, in
fact, justify the horrors of the present not merely as historically
necessary for the development of communism, but as actual reflections
of the <em>power</em> of the “multitude”, their historical subject.
</p>

<p>
It is particularly useful that, as Italians, Chrissus and Odotheus are
familiar with the various movements that have been influenced by
Negri, as well as with recent works of his that are not available in
English. This allows them to place <em>Empire</em> in a context that
further exposes its recuperative significance.
</p>

<p>
Chrissus and Odotheus clearly expose the love Hardt and Negri actually
have for the Empire and its methods of homogenizing the world. This
love, in fact, reaches the point of support for the European Union.
Negri recently co-edited a collection of texts by leftists in praise
of the political unification of Europe (choosing however to ignore the
fact that this unification is a reality mainly in terms of the needs
of the ruling class: a free flow of capital, the unification of
policing networks and so on).
</p>

<p>
More frightening is Negri’s and Hardt’s unquestioning support of the
totality of technological development — proclaimed to be expressions
of the desires of “the multitude”. They go so far as to call for the
“recognition [...] that there are no boundaries between [...] the
human and the machine” (<em>Empire,</em> p. 215) and, thus, the
acceptance of ourselves as cyborgs (see for example, <em>Empire,</em>
p.92). For them the project of technologizing life — i.e.,
biotechnology integrated with cybernetics — is desirable and
necessary, simply because it exists.
</p>

<p>
Chrissus and Odotheus also clearly expose the nature of the “subjectivity”
Hardt and Negri speak of repeatedly. This term, as the professors use
it, has nothing whatsoever to do with individual choice, will, desire
or self-activity. Instead it refers to the production of relationships
which <em>subject</em> us to the needs of the social institutions.
This is why “the production of subjectivity” must be grounded “in the
functioning of major institutions, such as the prison, the family, the
factory, and the school” (<em>Empire</em>, p.195).
</p>

<p>
In fact, Hardt and Negri absolutely reject the individual, seeing the
very concept of individuality as contrary to their project. On page
388, they tell us that “No ontology, except a transcendent one, can
relegate humanity to individuality”, and two pages later they say,
“...there is corruption as individual choice that is opposed to and
violates the fundamental community and solidarity defined by
biopolitical production”. Thus, singularity is not a trait of
individuals, but of “groups and sets of humanity”<a href="#fn1" class="footnote" id="fn_back1">[1]</a> biopolitically
singularized by “the multitude” (p. 395). And “the multitude” to which
they refer repeatedly is finally defined on page 316 of their book as
“the universality of free and productive practices”. To put it more
clearly: the forces of social production. The Marxist-leninist roots
of their perspective are clearly exposed. For them the subject of
liberation is precisely the productive apparatus for which we are mere
cogs.
</p>

<p>
With a notion of liberation that, in fact, means the absolute
subjection of individuals to the productive apparatus, Hardt and Negri
are correct to see their path as going “through Empire”, because their
project <em>is</em> that of Empire. But once the barbaric sword of
Chrissus and Odotheus cut through the professors’ convoluted language, it
becomes clear that those of us who desire our own liberation as
individuals, who want the freedom to create our lives on our times
have a project “<em>absolutely other</em>”: the total destruction of
the Empire here and now.
</p>

<p>
The time of the barbarians is at hand.

<h4 id="toc2">Introduction</h4>


<p>
Someone has noted that one of Marx’s greatest tricks was that of
having invented Marxism as a <em>lingua franca</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnote" id="fn_back2">[2]</a>. Since ancient
times it has been known that the art of persuasion consists of being
able to use speaking or writing to cause a precise psychological
effect in the one who listens or reads that goes well beyond the
contents developed in the reasoning. The Greeks said that persuading
meant to “lead minds to oneself”. Many Marxian expressions — and, one
could say, the “insidious clamor” of his prose — have enchanted,
terrorized, produced thousands of competing readings. Expressions such
as “Historically determined social conditions, extraction of surplus
value, objectively counter-revolutionary elements”, certain
journalistic techniques and the famous genitive inversions
(“philosophy of misery, misery of philosophy”): this jargon has
supplied many aspiring bureaucrats and true dictators with a reservoir
of pre-made phrases with which to justify their power. And it has
supplied just as many social democrats with a smoke-screen with which
to please anyone who is satisfied that capitulation in practice is
connected to radicality in style. The important thing was and is to
assume the attitude of one who knows what he/she is talking about with
scientific precision.
</p>

<p>
Antonio Negri’s texts play the same role today, if you will. In fact,
there are two “theoretical centrals” of the thing which journalistic
newspeak describes as the <em>anti-globalization</em> movement: the
<em>Le monde diplomatique</em> collective and our Paduan professor to
be precise. The monthly publication named after the collective, the
organization of conferences and seminars, the publication of books and
the creation of the so-called movement for the Tobin tax<a href="#fn3" class="footnote" id="fn_back3">[3]</a>
(<em>Attac</em>) — various Italian sections of which now exist — owe
their existence to the former. From the latter, who was one of the
original founders of Workers’ Power and then Workers’ Autonomy, came
much of the Italian workerist ideology and now the theory for which
the White Overalls (<em>Tute bianche</em>), the Disobedient
(<em>Disobbedienti</em>) and so many other global citizens are little
soldiers. Reading any flyer from any <em>social forum</em>, one will
indubitably find the following expressions: civil society, multitude,
movement of movements, citizenship income, dictatorship of the market,
exodus, disobedience (civil or civic), globalization from the bottom
and so on. Likewise, having a more or less extensive history, these
concepts, assembled in various ways, constitute the present-day Cliff
Notes for the alternative recuperator and ideal reformist. One of the
managers of this “ontological factory”, one of the technicians of this
“linguistic machine” is, once again, Toni Negri.
</p>

<p>
We will not fall into the banal error of believing that certain
theories are unilaterally influencing the movement. The theories
spread insofar as they serve specific interests and respond to
specific needs. <em>Empire</em> by Negri and Hardt is an exemplary
book in this sense. Together with the elaborations of their
“diplomatic” French cousins, its pages offer the most intelligent
version of the left wing of capital. The groups that refer to it are
the globalized version of the old social democracy and the gaseous
variants of Stalinist bureaucracy that have replaced the rigid
hierarchy of functionaries with the model of the network (or the
rhizome) in which the leader’s power seems more fluid. In short, the
communist party of the third millennium, the pacification of the
present, the counter-revolution of the future. Built on the decline of
the workers’ movement and its forms of representation, this new method
of doing politics no longer has privileged fields of intervention
(like the factory or the neighborhood) and offers a more immediate
terrain than that of the old party secretariats to the ambitions of
aspiring managers: the relationship with the mass media. This is why
the parties and unions of Left pose as allies of this new “movement”
and often go in tow to its initiatives, knowing well that beyond the
piercings of whatever little leader and certain slogans from
rhetorical guerrillas, the political disobedient represent the basis
(electoral, as well) of the democratic power to come. It maintains the
Stalinist role intact, but its future is inscribed above all in its
capacity to set itself up as a force of mediation between subversive
tensions and the necessities of the social order, leading the movement
into the institutional riverbed and carrying out a function of
denunciation of the elements that escape its control.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote" id="fn_back4">[4]</a>
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, after having progressively absorbed the social, the
State managed to suffocate all creativity under the institutional
burden; when forced to expel it again, it called this refuse <em>civil
society</em>, decorating it with all the ideologies of the middle
class: humanitarianism, voluntary service, environmentalism, pacifism,
anti-racism, democracy. In the overflowing passivity, consensus needs
continuous injections of politics. The disobedient politicians with
their citizens serve this purpose. Indeed, for the orphans of the
working class, it is the abstract figure of the citizen that now has
all virtue. Ably playing on the meanings of the word (the citizen is
at the same time the subject of the State, the bourgeois, the
<em>citoyen</em> of the French revolution, the subject of the
<em>polis</em>, the supporter of direct democracy), these democrats
address themselves to all classes. The citizens of civil society
oppose themselves to the passivity of consumers as much as to the open
revolt of the exploited against the constituted order. They are the
good conscience of the State (or public, as they prefer to say)
institutions, those who will always invite the police to “isolate the
violent” in any Genoa out of civic duty. With the complicity of the
democratic mobilizations of the “disobedient”, the State can thus give
greater force and credibility to its ultimatum: one either dialogues
with the institutions or one is a “terrorist” to hunt down (the
various agreements signed since September 11 are interpreted in this
way). The “movement of movements” is a <em>constituent</em> power,
i.e., a social surplus in relationship to <em>constituted</em> power,
an institutionalizing political force that encounters and intervenes
in established politics — in Negri’s conception, the militant version
of Spinoza’s concept of <em>potency</em>.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote" id="fn_back5">[5]</a> Its strategy is the
progressive conquest of institutional spaces, of an increasingly
enlarged political and union consensus, of a legitimacy obtained by
offering its capacity for mediation and its moral guarantee to power.
</p>

<p>
In the Negrian account, the true subject of history is a strange beast
of a thousand metamorphoses (first mass-worker, then social laborer,
now <em>multitude</em>) and a thousand tricks. In fact, it is this
being that has power even when everything would seem to bear witness
to the contrary. All that domination imposes is really what this being
has desired and won. The technological apparatus embodies its
collective knowledge (not its alienation). Political power favors its
thrusts from the bottom (not its recuperation). The legal Right
formalizes its power relationship with the institutions (not its
repressive integration). In this edifying historical vision,
everything happens according to the schemes of a most orthodox
Marxism. The development of the productive forces — authentic maker of
progress — continually comes into contradiction with social
relationships, modifying the order of society in the direction of
emancipation. The arrangement is the same as classical German social
democracy, to which the privilege of having broken a revolutionary
assault in blood and then thrown the proletariat into the hands of
Nazism is owed. And the illusion of opposing the power of political
institutions to that of the multinationals is a social democratic
illusion, one that Negri shares with the leftist statists of <em>Le
Monde Diplomatique</em>. If both denounce “savage capitalism”, “fiscal
paradises”, the “dictatorship of the market” so often, it is because
they want a new political order, a new government of globalization,
another New Deal. It is in this sense that one reads the proposal for
a <em>universal income for citizenship</em>. Thus, the less
“dialectical” Negrians have no scruples in openly presenting this
demand as a recasting of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
Despite two decades of heavy social conflict, capitalism succeeded in
turning the revolutionary threat around through a process that reached
its completion at the end of the 1970’s with the dismantling of the
productive centers and their spread over the territory and with the
complete subjection of science to power. This conquest of every social
space corresponds to the entry of capital into the human body, as the
final frontier that remains empty, through the very life processes of
the species itself. Necrotechnologies are the latest examples of its
longing for an entirely artificial world. But for Negri, this is the
expression of the creativity of the multitude. For him, the total
subordination of science to capital, the investment in services,
knowledge and communications (the birth of “human resources” according
to managerial language) expresses the <em>“becoming-woman</em>” of
labor, i.e., the productive force of bodies and of sensibility. In the
epoch of “immaterial labor”, the means of production that multitude
must secure for itself as common property are the intellects. In such
a sense, technology increasingly democratizes society, since the
knowledge that capital turns to its account surpasses every waged
sphere, in fact coinciding with the very existence of the human being.
This is what the demand for a minimum guaranteed wage means: if
capital makes us produce at every moment, then it should pay us even
if we are not employed as wage workers and we will make money for it
by consuming.
</p>

<p>
The conclusions of Negri and his associates are the complete
overturning of the ideas of those who, already back in the 1970’s,
maintained that the revolution passes through the body, that the
proletarian condition is increasingly universal and that daily life is
the authentic place of social war. The aim of recuperators is always
the same. In the ‘70’s, in order to gain their place in the sun, they
spoke of sabotage and class war; today they propose the constitution
of civic lists, accords with the parties, entry into the institutions.
Their jargon and their linguistic acrobatics show that the Marxist
dialectic is capable of every gallantry. Passing from Che to Massimo
Cacciari,<a href="#fn6" class="footnote" id="fn_back6">[6]</a> from the peasants of Chiapas to the small Venetian
endeavors, it now justifies snitching just as it justified theoretical
dissociation yesterday. On the other hand, as they themselves
recognize, it is not the ideas or the methods that are important, but
rather “the peremptory words of command.”
</p>

<p>
For “disobedient” theorists, the political institutions are hostage of
a multinational capital, mere registration chambers of global economic
processes. In reality, the development of technological power is the
material basis for the thing defined as <em>globalization</em>; and
from the nuclear to the cybernetic, from the preparation of new
materials to genetic engineering, from electronics to
telecommunication, this development is linked to the fusion of the
industrial and scientific apparatus with the military apparatus.
Without the aerospace sector, without the high-speed railroad, without
the connections through fiber-optic cables, without ports and
airports, how could a global market exist? We add the fundamental role
of military operations, the continuous exchange of data between
banking, insurance, medical and police systems, the State management
of environmental pollution, the increasing spread of the net of
surveillance, and it becomes clear that it is a mystification to speak
of the decline of the State. What is changing is merely <em>one
specific</em> State form.
</p>

<p>
Unlike other social democrats, for Negri the defense of the “social”
national State is no longer possible, inasmuch as it is a political
formation that is already surpassed. But this opens an even more
ambitious prospect: European democracy. In fact, from one side, power
is posed the problem of how to pacify social tensions caused by the
crisis in representative politics. From the other side, the
“disobedient” seek new paths for making the institutions democratic,
rendering the movement more institutional. Here is the possible
encounter: “Who then has an interest in the politically united Europe?
Who is the <em>European subject</em>? They are those populations and
social classes that want to build an absolute democracy on the plane
of Empire. What they propose is <em>counter-Empire</em>. [...] Thus
the new European subject does not refuse globalization, but rather
builds the political Europe as a place from which to speak
<em>against</em> globalization <em>in</em> globalization qualifying
itself (starting from the European space) as <em>counter-power</em>
with respect to the <em>capitalistic</em> hegemony of the Empire.”
(from <em>Political Europe Reasons for a necessity</em>, edited by H.
Friese, A. Negri, P. Wagner, 2002).
</p>

<p>
We have come to the end. Under a dense smokescreen of slogans and
catch phrases, under a jargon that both flirts and terrorizes, here is
a program that is simple for capital and magnificent for the
multitude. We’ll try to summarize it. Thanks to a guaranteed wage, the
poor could be flexible in the production of wealth and the
reproduction of life and thus relaunch the economy. Thanks to the
common ownership of the new means of production (intellect), the
“immaterial proletariat” could “begin a long Zapatista march of the
intellectual labor force through Europe”. Thanks to new universal
citizenship rights, power can pass through the crisis of the
nation-State and socially include the exploited. The masters don’t
know it, but finally left free to develop themselves, the new means of
production will actually realize that which they already potentially
contain: communism. It is only necessary to come to terms with obtuse
capitalists, reactionaries, neoliberals (in short with “bad”
globalization). The entire thing seems to be purposefully conceived to
confirm what Walter Benjamin ascertained more than seventy years ago,
a few weeks after the non-aggression pact between Stalin and Hitler:
“There is nothing that has corrupted German laborers as much as the
belief in swimming with the current. For them technological
development was the benefit of the current with which they decided to
swim.”
</p>

<p>
But the agitated waters of the current hide dangerous traps, as Negri
himself warns: “now we find ourselves in an imperial constitution in
which monarchy and aristocracy struggle between them, but the plebeian
assemblies are absent. This creates a situation of imbalance, since
the imperial form can only exist in a pacified manner when these three
elements are counter-balanced among themselves.” (from
<em>MicroMega,</em> May 2001). In short, dear Senators, Rome is in
danger. Without the “dialectic” between social movements and
institutions, governments are “illegitimate”, thus <em>unsafe</em>. As
first Titus Livy and later Machiavelli demonstrated wonderfully, the
institution of the plebeian tribunal served to counterbalance the
continual Roman imperial expansion with the illusion of popular
participation in politics. But the famous fable of Menenius Agrippa —
who addressed the mutinous plebeians telling them that only thanks to
them Rome lived, as a body lives only thanks to its limbs —
effectively risks coming to an end. The Empire seems to have less and
less need for the poor it produces, left to rot by the millions in the
reserves of the mercantile paradise. On the other hand, the plebeians
could become dangerous as a horde of <em>barbarians</em> — and descend
from the hills to the city, but <em>with the worst intentions</em>.
For the restless and unreasonable exploited, the mediation of the
managers might be as hateful as the powers in office and as
ineffective as a lesson in public spirit made to one who already has
his feet on the table. Police, even in white overalls, might not be
enough.

<h4 id="toc4">Empire</h4>


<p>
A nightmare torments the servants of the Empire — the nightmare of its
collapse. All the courtiers scattered around the world, political
celebrities and generals, administrative delegates and advertisers,
journalists and intellectuals, are asking themselves how to avert this
terrible threat.
</p>

<p>
The Empire is present everywhere, but doesn’t govern anywhere. Its
military invincibility shines in the sun dazzling its obsequious
admirers. But its foundations are rotten. The social order within its
borders is constantly called into question. In 1989, the fall of the
Berlin Wall was presented as the symbolic act that would ratify the
end of the “cold war” between the two opposed super-powers, the dawn
of a new era of peace and stability. The unification of the planet
under a single model of life, the private capitalist model, was
supposed to guarantee the definitive banishing of all conflict. In a
certain sense, one could say that the very opposite has happened. In
modern history, there have never been so many violent conflicts
bathing the world in blood as after 1989. If up to then, the various
armies were in a state of permanent readiness, now they are in
continuous mobilization. The military forces no longer spend their
time training, but rather fighting on the field. War has gone from
cold to hot, in some places boiling, and it is generalizing itself.
Only now the slaughter dictated by the State is no longer called war,
but rather police actions. Having extended itself everywhere, the
Empire no longer has external enemies from which to defend itself,
only internal enemies to control and repress. As the servants of the
Empire love to remind us, there is no longer an outside; there is only
an inside. But this inside is literally imploding.
</p>

<p>
In order to make space for itself, the Empire has swept away the old
model of the nation-State. But how does one convince entire
populations that were held together and rendered tame up to now by the
glue of popular identity that — for example — Serbs and Kosovars, or
Israelis and Palestinians, no longer exist, that instead there are
only subjects made similar through obedience to a single social
system? Thus, in the moment of its triumph, the Empire stirs up and
renews fierce civil wars.
</p>

<p>
In order to consolidate itself, the Empire has fused political and
economic power, scientific and military power in a single apparatus.
But how can it do without the specific political activity
indispensable to maintaining equilibrium — the mediation that is above
all moderation — without rushing at full speed into the unbridled
search for maximum profit? Thus in the moment of its triumph, the
empire rouses strong social tensions.
</p>

<p>
In order to take root the Empire has imposed the religion of money
everywhere. But how could anyone think that the transcendence of the
rites and traditions of thousands of years, which have saturated every
sphere of social life and given meaning to the existence of millions
of devotees, could abandon its place to the immanence of the commodity
without rousing rebellions? The sacred book of Christianity itself,
the Bible, records the fury of Christ before the presence of merchants
in the temple and their violent removal: “It is written: My house will
be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of thieves”
(Matthew 21:13). Thus, in the moment of its triumph, the Empire rouses
religious fundamentalism.
</p>

<p>
We find ourselves facing a paradoxical situation. On the one hand, the
reign of capital has succeeded in conquering an absolute domination in
uniting East and West under a single banner, in annulling every vision
of human existence that is not based on the laws of the economy. But
on the other hand, with all the power acquired, with its Praetorians
spread to every corner to protect profits, capitalism is demonstrating
that it is not in a position to control anything. The Empire is
feared, but it is not loved. It is endured, not chosen. It possesses
force, not consent. If it wants to remove the threat of collapse as
far as possible, it has only one path to travel: that of making people
accept it not through imposition, but through participation, that of
being recognized as right, necessary, inevitable.
</p>

<p>
But how can the Empire — synonymous with a social order based on
tyranny and arrogance, cause of cruelty and suffering — manage to make
itself loved by its subjects? It imposes control with weapons. It
obtains consent with blandishments. If the Empire wants to instill its
reasons into its subjects with the aim of making them accept and
appreciate these reasons, it must play tricks, having recourse to the
aid of emissaries. Those who shine only in the art of adulation are
certainly not among the most cunning since they would quickly be
unmasked for what they are — servants among servants. No, such a
complex and delicate task could only be brought to term by those who
know how to display the limits of imperial order. Biting observations
with regard to the Empire always fascinate the quarrelsome subjects
who are drawn into a fictitious complicity by these emissaries and
therefore don’t realize that the critique of imperfection is
functional to the achievement of perfection, transforming the Empire
from something we need to get rid of into something we need to correct
but that we cannot do without.
</p>

<p>
As evidence of the urgency with which the labors of restructuring and
enlargement of the imperial edifice must be carried out, its
emissaries are making themselves increasingly numerous. Two of them,
Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, have recently published a book that
is gaining a reasonable success. Flaunting their academic jargon in
order to subdue the ignorance of the subjects, the usual stale and
blunted intimidating weapon of intellectual terrorism in search of
approval, these two professors put the finger on the festering spots
of the Empire, seeking at the same time to explain to their reader why
they really cannot do without accepting it. The title of this
masterpiece of Empire-loving dissent is a homage to its beloved
parent: Empire.
</p>
<h4 id="toc5">Unwillingly</h4>


<p>
How is a condition of dispossession, of alienation, of exploitation
made acceptable without rousing some feeling of rage and rebellion?
The answer is only apparently impossible. It is sufficient to instill
the belief that what they are living through, governed by a tragic as
well as fatal necessity, is unavoidable in anyone who suffers this
condition. The instilling of dominant values, in fact, forms the basis
of social reproduction. Etienne De La Boetie, in his immortal
Discourse on Voluntary Servitude, makes note of how the servile
acceptance of the power of the few by the many can be traced back to
coutume, the meaning of which fluctuates between that of
historical-traditional custom and that of psychological habit: it
points to a process of adaptation to the form of society into which
the human being finds her/himself inserted, a process that ends up
determining a great portion of her/his behavior.
</p>

<p>
The main reason why people accept their submission to power is because
they are born and raised as servants. “It is still true” — La Boetie
argues — “that at first man serves unwillingly, constrained by a
greater power; but those that come later, having never seen freedom,
and not even knowing what it is, serve without any regrets and
willingly do what their ancestors did under duress. And so people who
are born with the yoke on their neck, nurtured and raised in
servitude, without raising theirs eyes even a little before
themselves, are satisfied to live as they were born, without managing
to imagine good and right things different from those that are to be
found in front of them, they take the conditions in which they are
born as natural.” This means that we can only become aware of the lack
of freedom if we have had a way of experiencing or knowing it. The
experience of prison is only a tragedy if we are able to compare it
with an experience of freedom, however supervised and conditioned it
may be, from which we were snatched at the moment of our capture. Our
desire for escape, for revolt, springs from the profound difference
that exists between these two lived experiences. But if we are born
and grew up in prison, if the walls of a prison formed our entire
horizon, filled all our dreams, marked all our actions, how could we
desire a freedom we had never known? Since detention had been our sole
and customary condition of life, perhaps we would consider it natural
and, finally accepting it willingly. Or even thinking, as Orwell
warned, that slavery is freedom.
</p>

<p>
Like other forms of domination, the Empire bases its continuity on the
supposed naturalness of the power that it wields. The critique of
Empire as such, in its totality and not in its individual aspects, is
made to appear as a form of madness or aberration. But this
objectification of domination requires further support, more solid and
convincing, beyond that of habit. As the same La Boetie recalls:
“There is no heir so thoughtless and indifferent that at some time he
doesn’t take a look at the family register to see if he enjoys all the
rights of succession or if instead there has not been some machination
against him or his predecessors.” Habit by itself is not enough.
Someone might end up getting bored with it and abandon this individual
psychological mechanism. Therefore, it is necessary to fix the “family
registers” with a collective historical mechanism, in such a manner
that their reading decrees a univocal and definitive result for
everyone. But how?
</p>

<p>
It is easy to comprehend that a total censure of our rights, the
exclusion of any of us from the registers to the exclusive profit of
the one who holds power would appear at least suspicious and might
provoke a furious reaction: and us, who are we? If nothing is given to
us, we will take it all! Rather, it is more intelligent to include us
in the legacy, to integrate us attributing the responsibility for what
happens to us, to deceive us with the request of participation in the
events of the family, in such a way as to make us perceive the reality
that surrounds us not as something that dominates us, but as a product
that we resolutely desire and to which we have directly contributed
with our activity and that consequently belongs to us. If “when the
State prepares to kill it calls itself the fatherland,” as Durrenmatt
said, it is because it wants citizens to fight, believing that they
are doing it for themselves, without noticing that they die “for the
bank vaults” (Anatole France, quoted on p. 93). In the same way, the
reason that the bosses call it a company when they prepare to make
profit is because they want their “subordinates” to work, thinking
that they do it for themselves, without noticing that they are
exploited exclusively for the bosses’ benefit. Obedience becomes
absolute, sheltered from doubt, when it is no longer seen as coercion
or hereditary weakness, but as the expression of a social will.
</p>

<p>
In this regard, the two emissaries seem exceedingly bashful in
affirming that “Flirting with Hegel, one could say that the
construction of Empire is good in itself but not for itself” (p. 42).
In reality, their relationship with the father of dialectics is not
mere coquetry; it is an authentic love story. Their analysis of the
Empire is carried out in conformity with the Hegelian dialectic. This
is no accident. Hegel was convinced that his philosophy would
represent the spirit of the time in which it had emerged. Therefore,
thanks to its superiority over philosophies of the past, he felt
compelled to claim as its task the demonstration that the society in
which it arose (i.e., the historical reality of the Prussian State)
constituted the peak of all previous civilizations. On careful
consideration, it is the same ambition that moves the two emissaries
with regard to the Empire.
</p>

<p>
One of Hegel’s peculiarities, that for which the shrewdest
functionaries of domination should remember him with gratitude,
consists in his understanding that unity — to which every form of
power aspires — would appear invincible if, rather than basing itself
on the exclusion of the multiplicity — i.e., the opposition — it found
its realization in the assimilation of the latter. In other words, for
Hegel, concrete unity could be achieved by reconciling differences,
not by exterminating them. It is only through the differences between
the multiplicity of things and through their conflicts that one can
achieve concrete, lasting unity. Thus, for Hegel, unity really springs
forth from the continuous struggle between the multiplicity of things
that compose it. His lie is manifest: if this unity doesn’t suppress
the multiple, it doesn’t realize it either, since it is limited to
domesticating it in order to place it in the service of the initial
thesis. This is the meaning of the dialectic to which Hegel entrusts
the task of revealing the most intimate processes of reality. In the
Hegelian dialectical process, the affirmation of a concept forms the
thesis; its negation forms the antithesis. From the conflict between
the thesis and the antithesis, the synthesis will be born, which
coagulates thesis and antithesis in a higher unity in which both are
conceived as different moments. But the synthesis represents in a
particular way a return to the thesis, in fact being a matter of a
return enriched by all the things that have been contributed by the
antithesis. It seems clear that the pure existence of two contraries
is not enough to generate a dialectical relationship. To achieve such
an end, something more is needed: mediation between the two
contraries. To mediate two contraries means to take away their
irreducibility, to bind them together, to create a communicative
bridge between them. It means to pacify them through reconciliation,
but to the advantage of one particular side — the one that was
strongest from the start.
</p>

<p>
According to Hegel, the dialectic was not just “the nature of thought
itself”. Maintaining the identity of the rational and the real, he
interpreted the dialectic as the law of reality as well. All reality
would move dialectically, following an objective mechanism. In such a
way that what is at the same time constitutes what must be, i.e., it
is self-justified in all its manifestations that are therefore
“necessary” in the sense of not being able to be different than what
they are. For Hegel, to oppose that which is something other to
reality means to abandon reason in favor of self-interest or
individual free will, a thing utterly mad since, in his opinion, only
the rational is real. Under the gears of this determinist mechanism,
history becomes the realization of a providential plane, and the State
becomes nothing less than the incarnation of the world spirit — a kind
of realization of God on earth.
</p>

<p>
What Hegel, as an honest subject of the Prussian State, never takes
into consideration is the possibility of a completely autonomous,
sovereign, uncompromising opposition — a multiplicity that does not
allow itself to be enrolled in any synthesis.
</p>

<p>
It is necessary to acknowledge that Hegel was an excellent emissary of
the Empire. His recognition of the role developed for the opposition
in the production of reality rendered him attractive to the left. His
synthesis that mediated contraries to the benefit of the original
thesis, i.e., the existent, rendered him attractive to the right. This
cheerful bourgeois man taught at the university of Berlin due to the
gracious permission of the king, not failing to celebrate the
anniversary of the fall of the Bastille each year with a bottle of
wine. The fact remains that the internal dynamic of the dialectic as
he conceived it is inseparable from the ideological proposition of the
justification of the status quo — it is enough to consider the ironic
observation of Bataille according to which “it is not romantic poetry,
but ‘obligatory military service’ that appeared to guarantee the
return to that common life without which, in his opinion, no knowledge
was possible.” The Hegelian supercession is nothing other than a
movement of conservation, of validation, of ratification of the past.
In a few words, Hegel was an important philosopher of recuperation:
power becomes stronger if, rather than closing itself in its castle
and putting dissidents to death — blind intolerance capable of
fomenting social hatred —, it welcomes their innovative ideas and even
puts them partially into practice, after proper sterilization, with
the aim of reinforcing its own legitimacy.
</p>

<p>
Hardt and Negri are scrupulous disciples of Hegel, as we will see. But
their analysis draws inspiration from other thinkers as well, some of
whom passed into history as subversives, although the effort to
justify the necessity of authority and the order it imposes is evident
in their work. Hegel’s most famous student, the Marx who was so
convinced that “the bourgeois has had a highly revolutionary function
in history” is another constant point of reference for the two
emissaries of the Empire, especially in the elaboration of political
perspectives. In fact, interpreting the entire history of humanity in
light of the Hegelian determinist philosophical mechanism, Marx openly
supported the progressive growth of capitalism as the way to reach
communism: “the development of big industry, thus, removes the very
terrain on which it produces the products and appropriates them for
itself from under the feet of the bourgeoisie. First of all, it
produces its gravediggers. Its decline and the victory of the
proletariat are equally inevitable.”
</p>

<p>
For Marx and for his crony, Engels, revolution did not constitute the
negation of the civilization of capital, a breaking point in its
deadly progression, but rather its felicitous final outcome. In the
certainty that the triumph of the bourgeoisie would automatically
provoke the triumph of the proletariat, he ended up supporting the
development of capitalism and fighting against those who opposed it.
This sort of disguised fatalism led him to assume rather reactionary
positions such as, for example, hoping for the victory of Prussia in
the war with France, in the conviction that the foundation of the
German empire by Bismarck would bring about the political and economic
centralization of Germany, a factor that in his opinion formed the
initial condition for the advent of socialism. Moreover, his idea of
social transformation as completion rather than rupture pushed him to
advocate the necessity of modeling the means and ends of proletarian
struggle on those of their adversary, theorizing that the workers
would have to organize in a party in order to conquer State power.
</p>

<p>
From this point of view, the analysis of the two emissaries is
rigorously Marxist. And given the nature of their mission, they could
certainly not do without the valuable suggestions of the counselor of
the Prince, the “democratic Machiavelli” who is considered the father
of modern politics, that is to say the Reason of State, expert in
swindling the people and keeping them in chains. They sing his
praises, omitting to mention his maxim according to which there is
“nothing [...] more vain and insolent than the multitude”. Even a
theologian who smells of heresy like Spinoza proves to be of use to
them, both for his philosophical reflections on the concept of potency
and for his theological-political reflections on the relationship
between democracy and the multitude. The family portrait is finished
with the philosophers known as post-structuralists, those French
thinkers who, in order to defend this society from the subversion
caused by the death of God — that in May ’68 had found a way to
concretize itself in their country in the form of the largest wildcat
strike in history — announced the death of man in every sphere, with
the aim of spreading resignation by making the individual into a mere
lump of social, political, technological and linguistic devices. The
influence of the “desiring machines” of Deleuze and Guattari is
particularly strong.
</p>

<p>
A certain involuntary sincerity in the two emissaries about the true
nature of their mission takes us be surprise when. In dealing with a
possible social transformation, they invite us to abandon the old
metaphor of the revolutionary mole in favor of the snake. In fact,
they expound, feeding the suspicion that “Marx’s old mole has finally
died. It seems to us, in fact, that in the contemporary passage to
Empire, the structured tunnels of the mole have been replaced by the
infinite undulations of the snake.” (p. 57) The mole has done its
time. Its extinction in the sphere of political zoology will be caused
by its blindness that renders it immune to calculation. And yet, if
this animal inspires sympathy, it is precisely because it is incapable
of intrigues. Armed only with stubbornness and guided by intuition,
the mole keeps on digging without ever losing its spirit, in hope of
emerging at the right place. The snake is a completely different
beast. It doesn’t dig, but crawls. It advances with “undulations”,
from right to left, from left to right (the image of opportunism).
Furthermore, since the time of Adam and Eve, it is known for its
forked tongue (symbol of the lie). Thus, at best, it represents the
dual nature of the two emissaries and their supposed fathers,
prodigals with bundles on their backs and broad smiles for the
subjects insofar as these latter intend to remain such.
</p>
<h4 id="toc6">Go to work!</h4>


<p>
The two emissaries describe the subjects as “multitude”, a neutral
term of the quantitative sort taken from some scholars of the past
that is useful for avoiding the encumbrance of using a qualitative
description of sides. Their aim is to convince the subjects that
although it may be true that the Empire shows many defects, it is also
true that its existence is the result of a right and inevitable
necessity. That if the Empire is the One that represents the Many, it
is only because it expresses them in a precise arithmetical sum, not
because it annihilates them inside itself. That its functioning is not
something that the multitudes now suffer, but that they themselves
have determined, intentionally or not. In a word, that the will of the
Empire is not, in fact, opposed to the desires of the multitude, but
that, on the contrary, it is their expression and realization, even if
lacking — which is why there is no reason whatsoever for wanting its
destruction. Quite so!
</p>

<p>
But let’s consider how the emissaries liquidate Etienne De La Boetie’s
critique. They are aware that “when the boss hails you on the shop
floor, or the high school principle hails you in the school corridor,
a subjectivity is formed. The material practices set out for the
subject in the context of the institution (be they kneeling down to
pray or changing hundreds of diapers) are the production processes of
subjectivity” (pp. 195–6) and that consequently “the various
institutions of modern society should be viewed as an archipelago of
factories of subjectivity” (p.196). But, in fact, the two emissaries
do not denounce the process of the reproduction of the existent with
its social division that, in everyday actions, in their serial
repetition, in the daily habit that accompanies us from birth to
death, day after day, without giving us a moment of autonomy, is the
thing that destroys the uniqueness of the individual. Rather they hail
the thing that constructs its subjectivity. The extraordinary
mystifying power of words! The misunderstanding is created through the
use of the concept of “subjectivity”, which they clearly prefer over
that of “individuality”. In themselves, the observations of the two
emissaries are accurate, but the meaning that is drawn out of them is
totally distorted, since the subjects are led to look with benevolent
eyes upon these “factories of subjectivity”. But ultimately, what is
so bad about this? Isn’t subjectivity “the quality of one who is
subjective”? And isn’t the subjective “that which is relative to the
subject, that which derives from the way of feeling, thinking and
deciding proper to the individual as such”? Any dictionary could
testify to this without uncertainty, but let’s take our consultation
further, to the bottom. What is the subject? The subject is “the
person or thing taken into consideration”, but it is also “one who is
subordinate, submissive, subjugated.” Indeed, these terms derive from
the Latin subiectus, past participle of subicere, or to subject. To
affirm that subjectivity is relative to the individual means rendering
submission natural, transforming a historical event into a biological
fact. So subjectivity expresses the quality of one who is underneath,
subordinate, submissive, subjugated. And what is the quality of one
who is subjected if not that of obeying, something that one will do so
much more willingly if one thinks that this is included in the nature
of the individual as such? This is how it is possible to use the
persuasive force of rhetoric to push the subjects to go to work in
these “factories of subjectivity”, i.e., of servitude, rather than
blowing them up.
</p>

<p>
Of course, a factory is more productive when discipline reigns among
the worker-subjects, but there is a problem. Far too often, the
subjects have the ugly defect of considering discipline a form of
domestication. This is why throughout history they have sought to
avoid it or shatter it in every way. ‘What ever for then?’ the two
emissaries ask themselves, convinced that “discipline is not an
external voice that dictates our practices from on high, overarching
us, as Hobbes would say, but rather something like an inner compulsion
indistinguishable from our will, immanent to and inseparable from our
subjectivity itself” (p. 329). It is undeniable that discipline is
inseparable from our subjectivity since, as we have just seen,
subjectivity indicates submission. But it is the claim that the strict
observance of the master’s rules by the slave is due not so much to
the fear of the lash as to “an inner compulsion indistinguishable from
our will” that Mr. Hardt and Mr. Negri cannot support without
admitting on which side of the barricades they are to be found: on the
side of those who uphold slavery. Their entire historical
reconstruction of the birth and development of the Empire goes in this
direction. The slave desires his chains and builds them himself. The
subjects desire the Empire and have built it themselves. Its formation
is inevitable because it expresses the biological outcome of human
nature and the dialectical out come of the history of humanity at the
same time.
</p>

<p>
The preoccupation with legitimating imperial determinism is also
manifested in the tiresome mechanistic language used by the two
emissaries, ultimately persuaded that they human being must fade into
the gear, that autonomy must give way to automatism, and that fantasy
must surrender before functionality. What is Empire? “Empire thus
appears in the form of a very high tech machine” (p. 39) or to be
clearer “Empire constitutes the ontological fabric”<a href="#fn7" class="footnote" id="fn_back7">[7]</a> (p. 354). What
are the subjects, the “multitude”? “The multitude not only uses
machines to produce, but also becomes increasingly machinic itself, as
the means of production are increasingly integrated into the minds and
bodies of the multitude” (p. 406). What is desire? Desire is described
as an “ontological motor” (p. 389). What is language? Unfailingly, the
answer arrives: “by language we mean machines of intelligence that are
continuously renovated by the affects and subjective passions” (p.
366). These are only a few examples of the technical — and, as such,
above sides — language that fills this text.
</p>

<p>
But presenting the evolution of civilization as the mechanism of a
megamachine is not enough. In saying this one justifies resignation in
the presence of the social pollution it produced, but the rage at
being changed into mere cogs is not neutralized. The two emissaries
must thus carry out another effort. They must make the subject
understand that “In reality, we are masters of the world, because our
desire and labor regenerate it continuously” (p. 388) and that
consequently we have very little to complain about. We, the masters of
the world?
</p>
<h4 id="toc7">The reverse side of the coin</h4>


<p>
In our unspeakable ignorance, we thought that the ambition of every
power was to consolidate and expand itself to the point where it
assumes true and proper imperial significance, but that the final
realization of this depends on the relations of existing forces. And
of course, this objective can only be achieved by knowing how to
generate the shockwaves necessary to disperse one’s adversaries. On
the contrary, the two emissaries declare: “The multitude called Empire
into being” (p. 43) since “the class struggle, pushing the nation
State toward its abolition and thus going beyond the barriers posed by
it, proposes the constitution of Empire as the site of analysis and
conflict” (p. 237).
</p>

<p>
We thought that labor was synonymous with human activity only within
capitalist society, a bit like animals in captivity are synonymous
with nature only in a zoo. An equation that is decidedly repugnant to
everyone except for those who think that “work makes us free”, as the
Nazis announced at the entrance of concentration camps, or who hold
that the bars of a cage serve to protect animals from external
dangers. On the contrary, the two emissaries don’t hesitate to argue
that: “Living labor... is the vehicle of possibility... labor... now
appears as general social activity. Labor is productive excess with
respect to the existing order and the rules of its production. This
productive excess is... the force of collective emancipation...” (p.
357), which is why “The new phenomenology of the labor of the
multitude reveals labor as the fundamental creative activity that
through cooperation goes beyond any obstacle imposed on it and
constantly creates the world” (p. 402).
</p>

<p>
We thought the identification of human life with the production of
goods was one of the most insipid advertising lies, incapable of
conceiving of anything other than economic balance sheets. This is the
sort of fraud that has reduced poetry to a source of inspiration for
advertising. On the contrary, the two emissaries inform us that “the
desire to exist and the desire to produce are one and the same thing”
(p. 349).
</p>

<p>
We thought that the hegemony conquered by the great multinationals
over international economic and political life, with the consequent
transformation of the world into one huge shopping center had brought
about the homogenization of lifestyles as well as the disappearance of
all singularity. As a noted American journalist pointed out, the
choice today is between Coke and Pepsi. On the contrary, the two
emissaries observe that “Far from being unidimensional, the process of
restructuring and unifying command over production was actually an
explosion of innumerable different production systems. The processes
of the unification of the world market operated paradoxically through
diversity and diversification...” (p. 252).
</p>

<p>
We thought that the blackmail which the subjects have to undergo,
working to survive or dying of hunger, was the element that forced
millions of people to abandon the land of their birth to go in search
of a morsel of bread. No one is so idiotic as to confuse emigration
caused by lack with the spirit of adventure born from exuberance. On
the contrary, the two emissaries hold that uprooting and mobility
constitute “a powerful form of class struggle within and against
imperial postmodernity” (p. 213) since “ through circulation, the
multitude reappropriates space and constitutes itself as an active
subject” (p. 397).
</p>

<p>
We thought that for over half a century technological progress was
maintained by research conducted in military experimental
laboratories, and was exploited for civilian purposes as well only at
a propitious moment. Through it Empire is able to reinforce its war
apparatus, perfect social control and maximize economic profit. On the
contrary, the two emissaries are convinced that only struggles
“constrain capital to adopt ever higher levels of technology and thus
transform labor processes. The struggles force capital continually to
reform the relations of production and transform the relations of
domination” (p.208).
</p>

<p>
We thought that the Internet represented a kind of New World for the
Empire: on the one hand the invention of yet another universe to
colonize, and on the other hand a way to ease internal social
pressures. Navigating in electronic limbo, the subjects can savor a
virtual freedom in exchange for real obedience. On the contrary the
two emissaries are moved, noting that “in the expression of its own
creative energies, immaterial labor thus seems to provide the
potential for a kind of spontaneous and elementary communism” (p.
294).
</p>

<p>
We thought that through information technology the Empire had
succeeded in imposing a reduced language based on technological
necessity and not on the richness of meaning. The subjects are forced
to give up meeting in a real plaza in direct communication, since this
is replaced by a virtual plaza with mediated communication; thus, they
are no longer able to discuss, expressing ideas and emotions with all
their incalculable shading, but only to exchange cold facts and
figures. On the contrary, the two emissaries are happy to “participate
in a more radical and profound commonality than has ever been
experienced in the history of capitalism. The fact is that we
participate in a productive world made up of communication and social
networks, interactive services, and common languages. Our economic and
social reality is defined less by material objects and that are made
and consumed than by co-produced services and relationships. Producing
increasingly means constructing cooperation and communicative
commonalities” (p. 302).
</p>

<p>
We thought that biotechnology represented the highest point of the
triumph of capital over nature, economic reason’s inroad into the
organic body. The proposal for genetically reprogramming the human
being, for suppressing differences in favor of the dominant normality,
made a brief appearance behind the promises of eternal health and
happiness (but it has now come in arrogantly). On the contrary, the
two emissaries do nothing but applaud this new conquest since
“Biopower — a horizon of the hybridization of the natural and the
artificial, needs and machines, desire and collective organization of
the economic and the social — must continually regenerate itself in
order to exist” (p. 389).
</p>

<p>
How many other untimely thoughts could still be expressed? If it has
been noted from more than one side how Marx could not hide a certain
admiration for the behavior of the bourgeoisie despite his criticisms,
for their part, the two emissaries show all their unbridled enthusiasm
for the world born from the planetary domination of capital, which
they pass off as the planetary triumph of the subjects: “Is it
possible to imagine US agriculture and service industries without
Mexican migrant labor, or Arab oil without Palestinians and
Pakistanis? Moreover, where would the great innovative sectors of
immaterial production, from design to fashion and from electronics to
science in Europe, the United States, and Asia, be without the
‘illegal labor’ of the great masses, mobilized toward the radiant
horizon of capitalist wealth and freedom?” (p. 397). Even the
greatness of the Egyptian pyramids could not form a valid
justification for the terrible suffering endured by the slaves who
built them, let’s just imagine whether transgenic corn, oil wells, the
procession of fashion or the microchip could be this justification!
</p>

<p>
But one last move is allowed to us. We thought that throughout
history, subjects, faced with great imperial power and Praetorian
arrogance, have always had very few alternatives: to obey or to rebel.
In the moments that they obey, the subjects merely reproduce the
Empire and guarantee its stability. Therefore, it is only in the times
of revolt against the order of the Empire that they can cease to be
subjects and determine themselves as free individuals, going to storm
the heavens of their aspirations. The two emissaries know this well,
but they also know that their task is really to place revolt in the
service of the Empire. It’s a matter of putting the unforgotten lesson
of Hegel into practice. The two emissaries themselves concede that
“The Empire does not fortify its boundaries to push others away, but
rather pulls them within its pacific order, like a powerful vortex”
(p. 198). Thus, the dialectic shows that the thesis is the Empire and
its foul<a href="#fn8" class="footnote" id="fn_back8">[8]</a> order; the antitheses are the subjects, the “multitude”,
and their struggle; the synthesis is reconciliation, the overcoming of
contradictions, which in reality conceals the return to the thesis:
the order of the Empire enriched by the creativity expressed in the
struggles of the subjects. It’s an outline that isn’t very far from
Marx’s interpretation of the servant-master dialectic that is found at
the origin of his concept of class struggle.
</p>

<p>
Interpreted in this way, it is possible for the long process that led
to the formation of the existent to no longer be perceived by the
subjects as domestication, but rather as liberation. That which is —
that is at the same time also that which must be — should no longer be
seen as a misery, but as a richness. Given that: “The multitude is the
real productive force of our social world whereas Empire is a mere
apparatus of capture that lives only off the vitality of the
multitude” (p. 62), one must deduce from this that “The refusal of
exploitation — or really resistance, sabotage, insubordination,
rebellion and revolution — constitutes the motor force of the reality
in which we live, and at the same time its living opposition” (pp.
208–9) The final conclusion of such reasoning is imposed by itself:
“The proletariat actually invents the social and productive forms that
capital will be forced to adopt in the future” (p. 268). In short, it
is not the Empire, through the exercise of power, but the subjects,
with their struggle’s against the Empire’s power, who are creating the
world that surrounds us. Thanks to their dialectical proceedings, the
two emissaries overturn reality and try to make the defeats of the
subjects pass for victories in perspective. Thus paradise approaches.
</p>
<h4 id="toc8">The heads of the eagle</h4>


<p>
It is true, however, that in doing so, Hardt and Negri occasionally
fall into some significant contradictions. It is not always easy to
convince the subjects that “The organization of mass trade unions, the
construction of the welfare State, and social-democratic reformism
were all results of the relations of force that the mass worker
defined and the overdetermination it imposed on capitalist
development” (p. 409). Whereas earlier they maintained that “Against
the common wisdom that the US proletariat is weak because of its low
party and union representation with respect to Europe and elsewhere,
perhaps we should see it as strong for precisely these reasons” (p.
269).
</p>

<p>
Why would the proletariat ever have had to impose its representative
forms on capital if its strength is greater without them? Starting
from the conception that unions and parties were conceded by power
because of the struggles carried out by the subjects, the two
emissaries try to interpret this as meaning that these same struggles
intentionally imposed them. Despite appearances, these two conceptions
are not the same thing. In the first case, the institution of
representation is a victory for power, a way to vanquish the
combativeness of the rebels; in the second case, it is a conquest of
the rebels, the objective attained by their battles. But if the
proletariat is stronger without unions and parties, as Hardt and Negri
acknowledge, then who benefits in instituting them? Clearly the one
who has granted them, i.e., power, that in this way blocks the real
threat brought about by a rebellion without mediation.
</p>

<p>
The first union did not appear until the second half of the
19<sup>th</sup> century. Any idea of class struggle, of the subversion
of the capitalist order, was completely foreign to it since its only
purpose was to reconcile the interests of the workers with those of
the bosses. By organizing workers on the level of struggles for
specific demands and seeking to limit exploitation to obtain a
distribution of production that was less unfavorable for the workers,
the union fights to obtain increases in wages, the reduction of
working hours, guarantees against arbitrariness, etc. In other words,
in the best of cases, the union aims to get a new division of the
goods, but without directly calling the nature of the social order
itself into question. Its function consists of offering correctives to
the development of capitalism, because capitalism’s ruthless search
for profit renders it myopic in the evaluation of the possible social
relapses provoked by its choices. This is why the nature of the union
is intrinsically reformist. Any economic struggle conducted within the
limits of capitalist society only permits the workers to remain
workers, perpetuating their slavery.
</p>

<p>
The tune doesn’t change when one examines the function of the party,
the origin of which precedes that of the union by a few years. Both
emerge in the period of the affirmation of the bourgeois class. In
England, the country with the oldest parliamentary tradition, parties
made their appearance with the Reform Act of 1832, which extended
suffrage, allowing industrialists and business people of the country
to participate along with the aristocracy in the management of public
affairs; there is no need to say to whose detriment. The real function
of parties appears in an even more visible manner in Germany, where
they were born for the first time after the disorders of 1848. This
means that it was the defeat of the revolution that gave birth to
parties, not its victory. It was the fear of a possible new uprising
of the masses that induced the State to loosen the chain of its
subjects, “conceding” the representative institution.
</p>

<p>
But, no matter how much it is lengthened, no matter how much more
movement it allows, a chain is still a chain. In any case, the history
of Germany shows how social-democratic reformism was really spread in
order to prevent a revolutionary solution to the social problem: Rosa
Luxemburg was murdered by the hired assassins of the social democrat,
Noske, who opened the way for Hitler’s conquest of power by repressing
the revolution of Councils.
</p>

<p>
The two emissaries start from an observation that could be considered
accurate, but once again they turn its meaning on its head. They have
reasoned perfectly in affirming that the reality that surrounds us,
the entire world in which we live carries the indelible mark of social
struggles under the cloak of grey conformity that envelops it. But
what they don’t mention is that this sign exists only in the negative.
We are surrounded by the ruins of our defeats, not by the monuments of
our victories.
</p>

<p>
An example for all. It is beyond doubt that the revolutionary
movements of 1848 pushed the French government to entrust the
architect, Haussmann, with the task of redesigning the city plan of
Paris, but it is equally true that the great boulevards that are
traveled by crowds of enraptured tourists were not devised with the
aim of facilitating “the nomadism of the multitude”, but rather the
movement of troops and their cannons in the eventuality of new
rebellions to repress!
</p>

<p>
It is true that the illegal activities of the subjects stimulate the
application of the results of scientific research, but our streets are
filled with video cameras in order to further social control,
certainly not to express the “machinic community” achieved by man
through technology. Rebellion pushes domination to perpetually remodel
the world, but the final result of this restructuring always
corresponds to the interests of those who govern, never of those who
rebel.
</p>

<p>
If on the one hand the two emissaries exalt the rebellions of the
subjects while on the other hand they maintain that their objectives
are realized by the Empire itself, it is because in this way they want
to create a necessary dependence, an unbreakable link between the
subjects and the Empire. Even the organic metaphors that they use are
indicative of this purpose: “The emblem of the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, an eagle with two heads, might give an adequate initial
representation of the contemporary form of Empire. But whereas in the
earlier emblem the two heads looked outward to designate the relative
autonomy of the respective territories, in our case the two heads
would have to be turned inward, each attacking the other” (pp. 59–60).
As if to say that, even if the aspirations are different, the body is
the same. Thus, the imperial structure doesn’t just respond to the
needs of the ruling class, but also to those of the ruled. The Empire
— with its army, its police, its courts, its prisons, its factories,
its commercial centers, its televisions, its expressways... — is
desired by the emperor as well as by the subjects. It is simply a
question of a problem between heads. Once this concept is brought in,
the subjects understand that the aim of struggle is to bring about
improvements in the Empire by choosing to follow the correct head,
thus leaving the body unchanged.
</p>

<p>
The entire analysis of Hardt and Negri aims to exclude any space for
autonomous revolt directed at destroying the body of the Empire as
well. It is a possibility that the two emissaries don’t even take into
consideration, so as not to evoke dangerous specters. When they
describe the Empire as a “smooth world”, they only end up confirming
the contrary so well noted by Benjamin in his time: “Celebration or
defense endeavors to conceal the revolutionary moments in the course
of history. The fabrication of a continuity stands at its heart. It
confers value only to those elements of the operation that are already
brought in to make part of its posthumous influence. The points at
which tradition is interrupted get away from them, and thus the rough
spots and crags that offer a hand hold to those who want to make their
own way beyond it.”
</p>
<h4 id="toc9">Freedom’s corrections</h4>


<p>
The Empire is right. The Empire is necessary. But unfortunately, the
Empire is not perfect. Its immense potentiality is held in check both
by the survival of dogmas of the past from which some imperial
functionaries have not managed to separate themselves and by the
opposition without compromise carried forward by those subjects who
refuse to be such with the greatest determination.
</p>

<p>
The excess or absence of the will to power are the two obstacles that
must be removed according to anyone who only aims for a just balance
of power: “The first is presented by the overbearing power of
bourgeois metaphysics and specifically the widely propagated illusion
that the capitalist market and the capitalist regime of production are
eternal and insuperable. [...] The second impediment is represented by
the numerous theoretical positions that see no alternative to the
present rule except a blind anarchic other and that thus partake in
the mysticism of the limit. From this ideological perspective, the
suffering of existence cannot manage to be articulated, become
conscious and establish a standpoint of revolt. This theoretical
position leads merely to a cynical attitude and quietistic practices.
The illusion of the naturalness of capitalism and the radicality of
the limit actually stand in a relationship of complimentarity. Their
complicity is expressed in an exhausting powerlessness” (pp. 386–7).
</p>

<p>
It is the struggle against these two supposed cohabiting forms of
impotence, accused of nothing less than preventing a mysterious
liberatory experience of work, that the two emissaries propose to the
subjects, who should certainly struggle against the Empire (i.e.,
against those functionaries who love it for itself), but they should
also struggle in favor of the Empire (i.e., against those subjects who
hate it in itself).
</p>

<p>
In order to resolve this problem, Marx’s contribution is fundamental.
Just as Marx proclaimed that the development of industry desired by
the bourgeoisie would lead the proletariat to victory, in the same way
Hardt and Negri maintain that the development of the Empire will lead
to the victory of the “multitude”: “The teleology of the multitude is
theurgical: it consists in the possibility of directing technologies
and production toward its own joy and its own increase of power. The
multitude has no reason to look outside its own history and its own
present productive power for the means necessary for its constitution
as a political subject” (p.396). This is why the best way to fight the
Empire consists, paradoxically, in facilitating its growth. In fact,
the two emissaries claim to be certain of the fact that: “The passage
to Empire and its processes of globalization offer new possibilities
to the forces of liberation. Globalization, of course, is not one
thing, and the multiple processes that we recognize as globalization
are not unified and univocal. Our political task, we will argue, is
not simply to resist these processes but to reorganize and redirect
them toward new ends. The creative forces of the multitude that
sustain Empire are also capable of autonomously constructing
counter-Empire, an alternative political organization of global flows
and exchanges. The struggles to contest and subvert Empire, as well as
those to construct a real alternative, will thus take place on the
imperial terrain itself — indeed, such struggles have already begun to
emerge. Through these struggles and many more like them, the multitude
will have to invent new democratic forms and a new constituent power
that will one day take us through and beyond Empire” (preface, p. xv).
</p>

<p>
It is thus necessary to pass through Empire in order to overcome it.
It’s not so much a question of resisting its processes as of
reorganizing them, possibly entrusting such a task to the right
people! Its formation is a positive event, because it offers infinite
possibilities to all. To think of acting otherwise, of attaining an
absolute break with the imperial universe, is an illusion born from
impotence. “The only strategy available to struggles is that of a
constituent counterpower that emerges from within Empire” (p. 59) the
two emissaries pound out without too much imagination. Who does not
recognize the notes of this song? It ultimately plagiarizes the dismal
refrain of Marxist-leninism: the counter-power of the multitude in
opposition to imperial power, counter-Empire in opposition to Empire,
counter-globalization opposed to globalization. And yet, who can
ignore how the mad conviction that the bourgeois State had to be
fought and replaced by a proletarian State only led to the
installation of particularly repugnant totalitarian regimes, where
courts presided over farce-trials, soldiers took part in firing
squads, police filled the gulags with dissidents, the ruling class
formed a grotesque bureaucracy, the population suffered a tremendous
oppression and misery?
</p>

<p>
But the two emissaries don’t pay attention to such trifles, confident
in the ability of the imperial model to welcome the differences
expressed by the “multitude” into itself without standardizing them.
It is sufficient to have the right constitutional form. It is no
accident if the principle rage that troubles them is: “What does it
mean to be republican today?” (p.208). The incredible aspect is that
they point to this question as fundamental and urgent for anyone who
intends to fight the Empire. The answer that they give doesn’t allow
for a reply: “Being republican today, then, means first of all
struggling within and constructing against Empire, on its hybrid,
modulating terrains. And here we should add against all moralisms and
all positions of resentment and nostalgia, that this imperial terrain
provides greater possibilities for creation and liberation. The
multitude, in its will to be-against and its desire for liberation,
must push through Empire to come out the other side.” Notice that the
only thing to do is to go through Empire in order to come out on
another side!
</p>

<p>
Besides, our two emissaries discreetly resort to the texts of Deleuze
and Guattari who maintain that, instead of resisting capitalist
globalization, it is necessary to accelerate its pace: “‘But which’ —
they ask — ‘is the revolutionary path? Is there one? — To withdraw
from the world market...? Or might it be to go in the opposite
direction?’” Hardt and Negri aggravate the matter: “Empire can be
effectively contested only on its own level of generality and by
pushing the processes that it offers past their present limitations.
We have to accept that challenge and learn to think globally and act
globally” (pp. 206–7).
</p>

<p>
From close up, this far-seeing hope of theirs greatly resembles that
of Leninists who take an oath on the temporary nature of the
dictatorship exercised by the party and on the imminent extinction of
the State (as soon as it has entered into their possession, of course)
and perjure themselves. It was sufficient to have the correct
communist program. In reality, once it has tasted power, with all the
vast privilege connected to it, no ruling class will ever voluntarily
renounce it. No State will ever extinguish itself on its own
initiative. In the same way, no Empire will ever respect and express
the multiple differences present within its borders. At most, it could
engulf them and grind them down like Moloch, in order to later spit
them back out in the form of substitutes (as the economic empire of
McDonald’s is doing to a slight extent in its various franchises
around the globe, where, along with the hamburger for which it is
unfortunately famous, it presents typical local plates which share
nothing with the native dishes but the name with which they are
advertised).
</p>

<p>
The Empire is not inclusive; it is exclusive. Even the history of the
pre-eminent Empire, that of Rome, is significant from this
perspective. No autonomy was conceded in the conquered territories. It
is enough to consider that in the language of ancient Rome, the two
concepts of foreigner and enemy are indicated by a single word:
hostis. The conviction that the Roman Empire was only interested in
the economic exploitation of subject peoples and that it was guided by
cosmopolitan ideals in their treatment is completely mistaken. As soon
as the Praetorian divisions extended military and political
subjection, the romanization of the occupied territories was also
carried out with implacable energy. The Roman Empire was nothing but a
State, a State intent on building up a colossal centralization of all
social energy. And annihilating difference — through repression or
homogenization — is part of the logic of every State that must
necessarily strain toward general unification in order to survive.
Whatever the idea it represents, whatever the social structure it is
manifested in, whatever individual or group of individuals exercises
it, in every epoch and in every social context, power is always
synonymous with exploitation and oppression. Since it cannot be
exercised by all individuals at the same time and without distinction,
equally and in conditions of absolute mutuality, power is therefore
the decision-making force concentrated in the hands of the few,
carried out and protected by armed force. Whether they are few or
many, capable or inept, this few will end up imposing their will and
making their interests prevail over all; they will end up becoming
oppressors.
</p>

<p>
This trait is so very visible in any epoch and in any human gathering,
that the two emissaries take good care not to ignore it. On the
contrary, they confront the problem directly, but in their own way:
“In the process of the constitution of sovereignty on the plane of
immanence, there also arises an experience of finitude that results
from the conflictive and plural nature of the multitude itself. The
new principle of sovereignty seems to produce its own internal limit.
To prevent these obstacles from disrupting order and completely
emptying out the project, sovereign power must rely on the exercise of
control. In other words, after the first moment of affirmation comes a
dialectical negation of the constituent power of the multitude that
preserves the teleology of the project of sovereignty. Are we thus
faced with a crisis in the elaboration of the new concept? Does
transcendence, first refused in the definition of the source of power,
return through the back door in the exercise of power, when the
multitude is posed as finite and thus demanding special instruments of
correction and control?” (p. 165).
</p>

<p>
To the enamored eyes of the two emissaries, the virtuous exercise of
power “seems” to meet with an insurmountable obstacle: the
“conflictive and plural nature” of the multitude. Unable to live
together with this freedom, power “must” correct and control it. An
unavoidable necessity, but one that may contradict its virginal
rectitude. Not wanting to escape this dead-end through an act of
force, the two emissaries are constrained to have recourse to an act
of faith. Through great stage tricks, they become converts — after
chewing it over a bit — to the old illusion of an American
Constitution without authority, a technical-juridical solution to the
“intrinsic limits” of power. “That outcome is a constant threat, but
after having recognized these limits, the new US concept of
sovereignty opens with extraordinary force toward the outside, almost
as if it wanted to banish the idea of control and the moment of
reflection from its own constitution” (p. 165). A truly astounding
conclusion if one considers the fate of the Native Americans, the
Indian tribes exterminated because their way of life was incompatible
with that of the young United States of America. Their genocide —
cleared away by the two emissaries as “a squalid event” — constitutes
the best example of the ability for any piece of paper to welcome,
express and guarantee the desires of the “multitude”.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that the infinite multiplicity present in the human spirit
can never be solicited, developed and protected by any form of power.
Chance does not love to see itself sewn onto a uniform. Fantasy dies
as soon as a legal code is applied. Even all the solicitude, the
prudence, the forbearance made available by a hypothetical
counter-power master of tolerance are only televised chattering and
academic speculation. No one can any longer ignore that in spite of
its supposed best intentions, counter-power will still end up
liquidating its rebels — guillotining them in the square in Paris,
cutting them down like partridges on the bastions of Kronstadt,
shooting them along the roadsides of Barcelona (or denouncing them to
the police in the alleys of Genoa). Excess cannot be contained in any
unity of measure,<a href="#fn9" class="footnote" id="fn_back9">[9]</a> no matter how generous it may appear or be. This
is why Empire is to be destroyed. Not reorganized, reoriented,
redefined, remodeled — but annihilated down to its foundation. In
their own way, even the two emissaries must confront the moment of
imperial decline and collapse. Having come to this point, the use of
the imperial conception itself forces us to come to terms with those
responsible for the end of the most famous Empire in history, the
Roman Empire.

<h4 id="toc10">Barbarians</h4>


<p>
The Empire has counted the hours. Hardt and Negri nurture no doubts on
this point, cherishing the certainty that “A new nomad horde, a new
race of barbarians will arise to invade or evacuate Empire.” (p.213).
Once the joyful tidings are announced, the only thing left then is to
again propose the question already raised by Nietzsche — where are the
barbarians? A basic question, but one to which it is impossible to
give an answer if one does not first confront another question — who
are the barbarians?
</p>

<p>
At his point it becomes necessary to deepen the concept of barbarian,
the definition of which contains more than one meaning. Etymologically
this term indicates the foreigner who came from another country and
who was unable to make him/herself understood and expressed
him/herself falteringly because s/he did not know the language of the
polis. Historically it points to an individual who is characterized by
blind, devastating violence, by savage roughness. The barbarian is the
one who does not speak the language of the city-State and also the one
who breaks loose with fury. On first view, it is not easy to
understand how this dual interpretation that appears illogical could
exist united in one word. Why ever should one who doesn’t speak our
language be a brutal savage? Why ever would one who resorts to the
most ferocious violence not be able to express him/herself through the
same words we use?
</p>

<p>
In reality, there is a profound link between the lack of a common
language and inexplicable violent behavior. Within a society, a common
language allows the sides to know each other, to reconcile
differences, to find an arrangement. In the case of a conflict, it
allows the adversaries to distinguish between friends and enemies,
limiting the use of force. Without this possibility of understanding,
there is no place for mediation, but only for uncontrolled violence.
Opposed forces can descend to pacts only if they are able to
communicate with each other. In the situation in which they fight, the
possibility for dialogue still places a limit on their violence. It
establishes a threshold beyond which not to go so that future
negotiations will not be nullified. But without this common language,
without the concrete possibility of knowing any thing about the other
— the basic premise for discovering the thing that can harmonize the
interests of the antagonists — nothing remains but to fight to the
last drop of blood.
</p>

<p>
In recognizing the barbaric traits that characterize many of the most
recent social struggles, the analysis of the two emissaries of the
Empire allows a bit of worry over their possible development to leak
out. Behind the formal flattery, the attempt to civilize the
barbarians, to educate them in the language of the polis-Empire with
the aim of averting their devastating and, above all, uncontrolled
violence, seems obvious. Hardt and Negri are aware that “Struggles in
other parts of the world and even our own struggles seem to be written
in an incomprehensible foreign language”(p. 57), and that this is why
they are barbaric. And they don’t notice any positive sign in this,
quite the opposite.
</p>

<p>
Not being able to admit the subversive potentiality of such
extraneousness, they prefer to announce that “these struggles not only
fail to communicate to other contexts but also lack even a local
communication, and thus often have a very brief duration where they
are born, burning out in a flash” (p. 54). The incommunicability of
the barbarians — the notorious “autism” of modern insurgents that has
caused so many rivers of ink to flow from the journalistic and
sociological rabble — becomes in the final analysis a dangerous
phenomenon not so much for the Empire as for the barbarians
themselves, inasmuch as it would not allow their action to spread more
widely in time and space. But would this be the motive that moves the
two emissaries to support the necessity to “construct a new common
language” (p.57), defining its realization as “an important political
task” (p.57)? Or isn’t the real reason that “Perhaps, precisely
because all these struggles are incommunicable and thus blocked from
traveling horizontally in a cycle, they are forced instead to leap
vertically and touch immediately on the global level” (p. 55), a most
dangerous matter since “the more capital extends its global networks
of production and control, the more powerful any singular point of
revolt can be” (p. 58)?
</p>

<p>
Bringing it down to earth, if the struggles were not manifest in such
an uncontrolled way — i.e., if they were not as irrecuperable as they
are incommunicable — they would be able to extend themselves on the
quantitative level, but would be qualitatively less meaningful. Here
it is possible to ascertain the real interest of the two emissaries:
better to spread struggle at low conflictuality, the eternal poverty
of making demands, than to support struggles with radical
characteristics and high conflictuality. Teaching barbarians the
language of the Empire (which is only able to express itself through
concepts such as State, party, constitution, politics, productivity,
work, democracy and withering away), the two emissaries indeed invite
them to multiply their struggles horizontally, but only because they
know that, once civilized, these struggles would become impoverished
vertically. They want to increase the quantity of struggle, aware that
this will occur at the expense of their quality, in faithful
observance of an inflexible law of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
Let’s take the concrete examples put forward by Hardt and Negri. If
the unification of markets has overcome every barrier in favor of the
free circulation of goods, then it should also smash every border in
favor of a free circulation of workers. Nonetheless, the “nomadism of
the multitude” knows a very precise obstacle: crossing the borders may
indeed be getting easier in some situations, but once one has arrived
at one’s destination, how does one respond to the police who demands
papers? So “global citizenship” is described as “a first element of a
political program for the global multitude” (p. 400). Once every one
of us has documents for residence, i.e., once we are recognized as
citizen-subjects of the Empire, “all should have full rights of
citizenship in the country where they live and work” (p. 400). In
fact, it is necessary not to forget that for the two emissaries, as
for the Nazis, it is work that makes one free, and it is really the
access to work that requires a universal constitution: “In effect this
political demand insists in postmodernity on the fundamental modern
constitutional principle that links right and labor, and thus rewards
with citizenship the worker who creates capital” (p. 400). In the
battles of all the irregular workers and undocumented immigrants who
work and demand to be legalized, Hardt and Negri see the just claim
for compensation that is due to the slave who is obedient to the
orders of the master. When it is accompanied by assent, subjection
deserves citizenship. What is completely absent in their outlook is
the possibility that the slave might rebel against orders and try to
break the chains that imprison him/her. Certainly identification
papers are to be numbered among these chains. The two emissaries are
quite careful not to consider that there are two fundamentally opposed
ways of obtaining freedom of movement. The first is the one that they
hope for, the one that foresees documents for everyone (even complete
with fingerprints!<a href="#fn10" class="footnote" id="fn_back10">[10]</a>). The second is the one that they do not
consider, the one that does not foresee any documents. The first
conception requires the modernization of the Empire’s bureaucracy; the
second requires its destruction. Either everything is placed in order
before the police, or we put an end to all orders and all police.
</p>

<p>
The same discourse applies to the other war-horse of the two
emissaries, that of the social wage and of the guaranteed income for
everyone. “Once citizenship is extended to all, we could call this
guaranteed income a citizenship income due each member of society” (p.
403), Hardt and Negri propose, in the poorly hidden hope that the
subject will be satisfied by a social reward — owed to them for their
mere consent, quite apart from the activity carried out — and will
therefore cease rebelling as those oppressed by the Empire and put
themselves to work as members of society. As opposed to those who
continue to think that communism is a world without money, the two
emissaries hold that it must inevitably take on the form of a waged
world — meaning a capitalistic world. This absolute inability of
theirs to imagine human existence outside the orbit traced by the
imperial institutions is not trivial: anyone who wants to communicate
with the Empire must learn to speak like the Empire, anyone who speaks
like the Empire ends up thinking like the Empire.
</p>
<h4 id="toc11">The inadequacy of the no</h4>


<p>
The conversion of the barbarians operates on all levels. They must not
only learn the language of the Empire; they must also renounce their
violence. But if convincing them to go to school is relatively easy —
it is enough to promise a quantitative leap — what reasoning can be
used to invite those who consider the use of force a virtue to lay
down their swords? Through a game of rhetorical trickery that turns
the stainless myth of the Resistance around. Quoting an antifascist
partisan, the two emissaries recall that “Resistance is born of
desertion” (p. 205). Strengthened by this historical truth, Hardt and
Negri maintain that “Whereas in the disciplinary era sabotage was the
fundamental notion of resistance, in the era of imperial control it
may be desertion. Whereas being-against in modernity often meant a
direct and/or dialectical opposition of forces, in post-modernity
being-against might well be most effective in an oblique or diagonal
stance. Battles against the Empire might be won through subtraction
and defection. This desertion does not have a place; it is the
evacuation of the places of power” (p.212).
</p>

<p>
As often as they display their whole inventory as word manipulators,
in this instance, the trick they use is much too shabby. Resistance is
born of desertion, but it is not desertion. Desertion only consists of
a non-participation, a non-collaboration in the projects of the enemy.
Resistance however is direct intervention, face-to-face conflict with
the enemy. At most, one could say that desertion was a form of passive
resistance, while the partisan struggle was a form of active
resistance. Those who become aware of living in an intolerable social
situation, in a world based on the wealth of the few and the misery of
the many, those who no longer want to feel responsible for the horrors
committed every day, can cease to make their contribution to the
continuation of the existent. For example, they can stop going to the
polls or acquiring merchandise from the large multinationals. But
however much one may appreciate the intentions, this choice is
completely inadequate since in itself it is not able to concretely
call the social order into question and ends up as a rather limited
gesture of refusal. It pacifies the guilt feelings of the conscience,
but it doesn’t change the surrounding reality. In order to stop the
enemy, it is not enough to refuse to give your service or to abstain
from associating with it. It is necessary to attack it and strike it
with the intention of destroying it.
</p>

<p>
Supporting desertion at the expense of sabotage, the two emissaries do
nothing more than support the Empire. Just as Nazism continued to
occupy and oppress Italy despite its deserters, in the same way, the
Empire will continue to occupy and oppress the entire planet in spite
of its deserters. All this rhetoric about the resistance of desertion
awkwardly pursues a single aim, that of pacifying the rage of the
subjects by offering them the safety valve of abandonment and denying
the necessity and urgency of the direct attack against the Empire.
Through these charlatans’ subterfuges, the barbarians are invited to
take as an example not the determination of the deserters, which would
have led them to active resistance, but rather the initial behavior,
in other words, they are invited to emulate the gesture for which the
deserters became famous: throwing down their arms and refusing to
fight.
</p>

<p>
It is clear that once Hardt and Negri had used the imperial metaphor,
they could not do anything but await the coming of the “new
barbarians”. It is enough that these barbarians simply cease to be so:
yes to a comprehensible language, no to violence. The latter is no
longer useful: on the one hand, “Imperial corruption is already
undermined by the productivity of bodies, by cooperation, and by the
multitude’s designs of productivity. The only event that we are still
awaiting is the construction, or rather the insurgence of a powerful
organization” (p. 411); While on the other hand, “Militants resist
imperial command in a creative way. In other words, resistance is
linked immediately with a constitutive investment in the biopolitical
realm and to the formation of cooperative apparatuses of production
and community” (p. 413). For fear of being misunderstood, the two
emissaries are forced to explain themselves with a certain clarity:
They do not, in fact, hope for the coming of the barbarian horde, but
rather of a powerful organization of militants! They don’t appreciate
those who struggle furiously, but rather those who work productively!
They don’t demand that one follows one’s passions, but that one
carries out one’s obligations! They don’t desire one to wreak havoc
among the enemies, but to resist creatively!
</p>

<p>
Hardt and Negri appreciate the Empire to such a degree, they are so
molded by its values, worshipful of its organization, assimilated to
its technology, accustomed to its language, as to conclude that
militancy “knows only an inside, a vital and ineluctable participation
in the set of social structures, with no possibility of transcending
them” (p. 413). Here we are before yet another example of dialectical
acrobatics. While they launch vibrant appeals to the subjects so that
they start off on the road to exodus, at the same time they affirm
many times that within the Empire there is no elsewhere, no outside
with respect to an inside.
</p>

<p>
But if the Empire is everywhere, If limits that define its territory
no longer exist, where would this Promised Land toward which to lead
the exodus of the “multitude” ever be found? Does a free zone exist on
this planet, a place that remains uncontaminated by the logic of power
and profit? Unfortunately, the world is One, and it is completely
under the domination of the Empire. No substantial alternatives are
permitted within it. At most, it allows us to adapt ourselves to its
arrangements, giving up any existence of our own. This corresponds to
extinguishing us — the quiet life of resignation. At best, it is
possible for us to survive in a way that is less bad, inserting
ourselves in any of its cracks. This is why anyone who desires to
live, that is to determine for herself the content and the form of his
days on this earth, has only one card to play. Before being the
indispensable, preliminary condition of real freedom, the insurrection
against the Empire is a question of dignity.
</p>
<h4 id="toc12">Without any reason</h4>


<p>
Today the barbarians no longer camp at the gates of the City. They
already find themselves inside it, because they were born in it. There
are no longer cold lands of the North or barren steppes of the East
from which to start the invasion. It is necessary to recognize that
the barbarians arise from the ranks of the imperial subjects
themselves. In other words, the barbarians are everywhere. For ears
accustomed to the language of the polis, it is easy to recognize them,
because when they express themselves, they stammer. But there is no
need to let oneself be fooled by the incomprehensible sound of their
voices; there is no need to confuse the one without a language with
the one who speaks a different language.
</p>

<p>
Many barbarians really are deprived of a recognizable language,
rendered illiterate by the suppression of their individual awareness —
a consequence of the extermination of meaning carried out by the
Empire. If one does not know how to talk, it is because one does not
know what to say, and vice versa. And one does not know what and how
to speak because everything has been banalized, reduced to mere
symbol, to appearance. Meaning, which was considered one of the
greatest sources of revolt, a radiant fount of energy, has been eroded
in the course of the past few decades by a whole company of imperial
functionaries (for example, the French structuralist school so dear to
the two emissaries). They have shattered, pulverized and minced it in
every sphere of knowledge. Ideas that expound and incite to
transformative action have been cancelled and replaced by opinions
that comment and rivet in conservative contemplation. Where there was
once a jungle full of danger because it was wild and luxuriant, a
desert has been created. And what does one say, what does one do, in
the midst of a desert? Deprived of words with which to express rage
for the suffering one has undergone, deprived of hope with which to
overcome the emotional anguish that devastates daily existence,
deprived of desires with which to struggle against institutional
reason, deprived of dreams toward which to reach in order to sweep
away the repetition of the existent, many subjects become barbaric in
action. Once the tongue is paralyzed, the hands quiver to find relief
from frustration. Inhibited from manifesting itself, the compulsion
toward the joy of living is turned on its head, becoming its opposite,
the death instinct. Violence explodes and, being without meaning,
manifests itself in a blind and furious manner, against everything and
everyone, overturning every social relationship. Where there is not a
civil war going on, there are the rocks thrown from overpasses or the
murders of parents, friends or neighbors. It is not revolution or even
revolt; it is a generalized slaughter carried out by subjects who have
been made barbaric by the wounds inflicted on their hides every day by
a world that is without meaning because it is forced to have a single
meaning. This dreary and desperate violence annoys the Empire,
disturbed in its presumption of guaranteeing total tranquility, but it
is not worried about this. In itself, this does nothing but feed the
demand for greater public order. And yet, however easily recuperable
once it is brought out to the surface, it shows all the restlessness
that stirs in the depths of this society, all the precariousness of
the imperial hold over the circumstances of the modern world.
</p>

<p>
And yet there are other barbarians of a different sort. They are
barbarians insofar as they are refractory against the words of
command, certainly not insofar as they are deprived of awareness. If
their language seems obscure, irritating, stuttering, it is because it
does not endlessly conjugate the imperial Verb to the infinitive.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote" id="fn_back11">[11]</a>
These barbarians are all the ones who deliberately refuse to follow
the institutional itinerary. They have other paths to travel, other
worlds to discover, other existences to live. To the virtuality —
understood as simulation — of technology that originates in sterile
laboratories, they oppose the viruality — understood as possibility —
of aspirations that originate in the palpitations of the heart. In
order to give form and substance to these aspirations, in order to
transform them from virtual into real, they must snatch the time and
space necessary for their realization from the Empire by force. That
is to say, they must manage to reach a total rupture with the Empire.
</p>

<p>
These barbarians are also violent. But their violence is not blind
toward those they strike, but rather toward imperial reason. These
barbarians don’t speak or understand the language of the polis, and
they have no desire to learn it. They have no use for the social
structures of the Empire, the American constitution, the current means
of production, identification papers or the social wage to which the
two emissaries so much adhere. They have nothing to demand of imperial
functionaries and nothing to offer them. The politics of compromise
has failed from the start, not due to a ridiculous ideological
process, but due to their inadequacy to this world. These barbarians
only know that to realize their desires, whatever they are, they must
first clear out the obstacles that they encounter on their path. They
have no time to ask themselves how “capitalism is miraculously
healthy, its accumulation more robust than ever” (p. 270), as the two
emissaries comically slow down to do, perturbed that history refuses
to function in compliance with the well-oiled mechanisms of a machine.
The “mystery of capital’s continuing health” (p. 270) doesn’t manage
to rouse the passion of these barbarians as much as the urgency of its
death. This is why they are ready to lay waste to the metropolises —
with their banks, their shopping centers, their police-oriented city
planning — at any moment, individually or collectively, in the light
of the sun or in the dark of the night. If they don’t have a single
reason for doing so, it is because they have all of them.
</p>

<p>
In opposition to the discontented subjects who want to become
contented subjects, the possibility of another world does not concern
these barbarians. They prefer to fight because they think that a world
absolutely other is possible. They know that “another world” will be
like “another day”, the empty and boring repetition of what has come
before it. But a world absolutely other is a completely unknown world
to dream, to create, to explore. Having been born and raised under the
imperial yoke, without ever having had the possibility of
experimenting with radically different ways of living it is not
possible to imagine a world absolutely other except in negative terms,
as a world without money, without laws, without work, without
technology and without all the numberless horrors produced by
capitalist civilization.
</p>

<p>
Unable to conceive of a world without masters to serve, the two
emissaries interpret this absence as a lack. It is their ridiculous
belief that the Empire is the destiny of humanity that causes them to
say: “The refusal of work and authority, or really the refusal of
voluntary servitude, is the beginning of liberatory politics [...]. In
political terms, too, refusal in itself (of work, authority and
voluntary servitude) leads only to a kind of social suicide. As
Spinoza says, if we simply cut the tyrannical head off the social
body, we will be left with the deformed corpse of a society” (p. 204).
The tyrant is the head, the reason that guides; The subjects are the
muscles, the strength that works. Rather than Spinoza, the two
emissaries should have quoted the patricians of ancient Rome, who
informed the plebeians who were on the verge of rebelling that if the
subjects rise up and put the tyrant to death, they commit suicide,
because there cannot be life without someone who commands.
</p>

<p>
The eternal lie that maintains all exercise of power finds two fervent
followers in Hardt and Negri, who are available to argue that that the
refusal of authority is suicide and that anarchism is a form of
impotence. As has been noted many times and from many sides, it is
really destruction that opens the door to creation; mere refusal does
nothing more than render the ground fertile for a new affirmation.
Contrary to what the two emissaries think, the tyrant — and every
power structure is tyrannical — is not the head of the social body,
but rather the parasite that poisons its organism. Killing it is an
act of liberation. The Parisian revolutionary clubs did not suffer
from the beheading of king Louis XVI, nor did the Russian workers’
councils suffer from the fall of Tsar Nicholas II. Rather, the
liquidation of power, i.e., the insurrectional context that brought
down the ancient customs and released new energies, is what really
allowed their birth and their spread. And the reintroduction of power,
in Jacobin or Bolshevik form, is what really brought about the
stalemate and the ruin of the process of social regeneration, bringing
that which is Unknown back to that which is State.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote" id="fn_back12">[12]</a>
</p>

<p>
Whoever does not speak with me and like me has nothing to say. Whoever
does not act with me and like me is sick with impotency. Whoever does
not live with me and like me desires to kill herself. This is the
teaching that the Empire spreads among its enemies from the mouths of
the two emissaries. But the barbarians are deaf to such foolish
warnings; their ears are sensitive only to the voices that call them
to the assault against the Empire, to making a clean sweep of the
existent. Their fury even inspires terror in many enemies of the
Empire who indeed desire to defeat it, but with good manners. As
civilized cutthroats, they share the dissent but not the hatred; they
understand the indignation but not the rage; they hurl protests
slogans but not war cries; they are ready to shed saliva but not
blood. They too — it is clear — desire the end of the Empire, but they
wait for it to happen spontaneously, as a natural phenomenon. Pushed
by the certainty that the Empire is seriously ill, its most educated
enemies hope that a collapse frees humanity from its cumbersome
presence as soon as possible. Besides, no one can deny that it is much
less dangerous to obtain freedom after the peaceful departure of the
master, like a hereditary fortune, rather than conquering it in
battle. This indisputable observation leads them to sit on the banks
of the river waiting to see the corpses of their enemies pass by
carried by the currents.
</p>

<p>
The barbarian nature is quite different; it doesn’t know this gentle
patience. In fact, the barbarians are persuaded that it is vain to
wait for the death of the Empire, which above all might not be quite
so imminent as its civil enemies hope. Besides, this all leaves one to
assume that at the moment of its collapse the Empire will bury
everything, really everything, under its ruins. Then what is the
purpose of waiting? Isn’t it better to go in search of the enemy and
do everything possible to get rid of it? This barbaric determination
rouses horror. The two emissaries are horrified; according to them the
identification of the enemy is “the first question of political
philosophy” (pp. 210–211) and as such cannot be concerned with
barbarians, who in their coarseness are able at best to move “round in
such paradoxical circles” (p. 211).
</p>

<p>
But the well brought up enemies of the Empire are also horrified.
Accustomed to using up their days in waiting to be able to start
living, they mistake barbaric immediacy for bloodthirstiness. And how
could it be otherwise? They are completely unable to comprehend what
the barbarians are fighting for, since barbaric language is still
incomprehensible to their ears. The cry of the barbarians is much too
infantile for them, their boldness much too gratuitous. In the face of
the barbarians, they feel as powerless as an adult at grips with
roused children. In fact, for the ancient Greeks the barbarian was
quite similar to the child, while in Russian the two concepts are
expressed with the same word (and let’s consider the Latin infans,
infant, that literally means not speaking). Well then, the thing that
those who don’t speak, the stammerers, are most reproached for is the
lack of seriousness, of reasonableness, of maturity. For barbarians,
as for children, whose nature has not yet been completely
domesticated, freedom does not start with the elaboration of an ideal
program but with the unmistakable din of broken crockery. This is the
thing that raises the protests of those who think, with Lenin, that
extremism is only an “infantile disorder”. Against the senile disorder
of politics, the barbarians affirm that freedom is the most urgent and
terrifying need of human nature. And unbridled freedom makes use of
all the world’s products, of all the objects, using them as
playthings.
</p>

<p>
But the offspring of the goddess Reason don’t allow for a social
transformation that is not based on the edification of the Public
Good. It’s either a question of a return to a mythical past (the
primitivist illusion) or of the fulfillment of a radiant future (the
messianic illusion). As for the barbarians, they love neither
nostalgic sighs nor architectural diplomas. That which is is not
destroyed in the name of that which was or of that which will be, but
in order to finally give life to everything that could be, in its
boundless possibilities, here and now. Right now.
</p>
<h4 id="toc13">To put an end to it</h4>


<p>
It is useless to try to teach one who has no tongue how to speak. It
is useless to take fright in the face of guttural sounds and
thoughtless acts. It is useless to propose mediation to one who wants
the impossible. It is useless to beg for freedom from one who imposes
slavery. Let’s leave pedagogy to the two emissaries, together with
their police and missionary spirit. May the barbarians break loose.
May they sharpen their swords, may they brandish their battleaxes, may
they strike their enemies without pity. May hatred take the place of
tolerance, may fury take the place of resignation, may outrage take
the place of respect. May the barbarian hordes go to the assault,
autonomously, in the way that they determine. And may no parliament,
no credit institution, no supermarket, no barracks, no factory ever
grow again after their passage. In the face of the concrete that rises
to strike the sky and the pollution that fouls it, one can well say
with Dejacque that “It is not the darkness that the Barbarians will
bring to the world this time, it is the light.”
</p>

<p>
The destruction of the Empire could hardly assume the customary forms
of social revolution, as we have come to know them from the history
books. (the conquest of the Winter Palace, the popular reaction to a
blight, the general wildcat strike).
</p>

<p>
There are no longer any noble ideas capable of stirring the great
proletarian masses, there are no longer sweet Utopias ready to be
fertilized by their lovers, there are no longer radical theories that
only wait to be put into practice. All this has been overwhelmed,
swept away by the imperial slime. There is only the disgust, the
desperation, the repugnance of dragging our existence through the
blood spilled by power and the mud flung up by obedience. And yet in
the midst of this blood and mud, the will — confused in some and
clearer in others — to put an end to the Empire and its deadly order
once and for all can be born.

in life but in desire, a world that no man has known in life but that
many of us have known in dreams. And dreaming, time would fly by, and
my body would stand weariness at bay, and I would redouble my
enthusiasm, and become bold, and go out on reconnaissance at dawn to
find out the enemy’s position and...All this in order to change life,
