I have no ancestors! For me the creation of the world dates
from the day of my birth; for me the end of the world will
be accomplished on the day when I shall restore to the elementary mass the apparatus and the afflatus which constitute my individuality.
I am the first man, I shall be the last. 
My history is the complete result of humanity; I know no
other, I care to know no other. When I suffer, what good
do I get from another's enjoyment? When I enjoy, in what
do those who suffer detract from my pleasures? Of what
consequence to me is that which happened before me?
How am I concerned in what will happen after me? It is not
for me to serve as a sacrifice to respect for extinct generations, or as an example to posterity. I confine myself
within the circle of my existence, and the only problem
that I have to solve is that of my welfare. I have but one
doctrine, that doctrine has but one formula, that formula
has but one word: ENJOY! Sincere is he who confesses it;
an imposter is he who denies it.
<br><br>
This is bare individualism, native egoism; I do not deny it, I
confess it, I verify it, I boast of it. Show me, that I may question him, the man who would reproach and blame me.
Does my egoism do you any harm? If you say no, you have
no reason to object to it, for i am free in all that does not
injure you. If you say yes, you are a thief, for, my egoism being only the simple appropriation of myself by myself, an
appeal to my identity, an affirmation of my individuality,
a protest against all supremacy, if you admit that you are
damaged by my act in taking possession of myself, by my
retention of my own person — that is, the least disputable
of my properties — you will declare thereby that I belong
to you, or, at least, that you have designs on me; you are an
owner of men, either established as such or intending to
be, a monopolist, a coveter of another's person, a thief.
There is no middle ground; either right lies with egoism,
or it lies with theft; either I belong to myself, or I become
the possession of someone else. It cannot be said that I
should sacrifice myself for the good of all, since, all having
to similarly sacrifice themselves, no one would gain more
by this stupid game than he had lost, and consequently
each would remain destitute — that is, without profit,
which clearly would make such sacrifice absurd. If, then,
the abnegation of all cannot be profitable to all, it must of
necessity be profitable to a few; these few, then, are the
possessors of all, and are probably the very ones who will
complain of my egoism.
<br><br>
Every man is an egoist; whoever ceases to be one becomes
a thing. He who pretends it is not necessary to be one is a
sly thief.
<br><br>
Oh, yes, I know, the word has an ugly sound; so far you
have applied it to those who are not satisfied with what
belongs to them, to those who take to themselves what
belongs to others; but such people are in accord with
human impulse; you are not. In complaining of their
rapacity, do you know what you do? You establish your
own imbecility. Hitherto you have believed there were
tyrants. Well, you are mistaken: there are only slaves.
<br><br>
Where nobody obeys nobody commands.

The history of civilization is the search for Utopia, the pursuit of a
static, idealized social form where all individuality and variation is melted
into the crucible of one unifying belief system. It has been a millennia-long military campaign to contain all within a single structure, where
constant sameness is the ideal, to absorb and convert the outsiders who
venture within the charmed circle, and to flatten and standardize life by
entangling all of us in the spiderweb of an abstract social contract. The
civilizing process itself — that is, domestication — is part and parcel of
the utopian project, as it attempts to perfect and re-engineer the vital
forces of the self-exalting individual, to turn humans — who are a self-centered mixture of hate and gentleness, violence and peace, greed
and generosity — into masked animals who feel shame for all that is
biological and natural, to render them internally fragmented, divided,
and broken (and hence, more amenable to control). To accomplish this,
society invents ideas and images to cover those instincts it considers
in need of taming; it formulates various ideologies to convince its
subjects that selfishness is wrong and should be suppressed, and
that the healthy egoistic impulses of a free man or woman must be
denied expression in the interests of group-stability. From the ideal
republic of Plato to the ideal republic of Lenin, civilization has produced
unquantifiable, competing visions of Utopia that each vie for mastery,
and that each bear identifiable similarities: They are routinely masked
under philanthropic guises, and they all advocate the absorption of the
individual into the social body — often (and almost satirically) in the
name of "collective freedom".

The sole utopian current that explicitly asserts the sovereignty of
the individual is anarchism, certainly the most paradoxical of the “isms”
because it insists on absolute individual and collective freedom. From
these shared propositions have emerged the unavoidable dilemmas:
how to synthesize complete individual freedom with social identification
and a strong sense of social responsibility? Is self-determination
compatible with any kind of social contract? And more pointedly, do
most people even want the unconditional freedom that anarchism,
in its more glorious and inspired moments, postulates? These are the
questions that have always checkmated anarchists who engage in large-scale social planning. They start out talking about anarchy and end up
advocating some particularly weak version of direct democracy.

But how could it be otherwise? Every attempt to free humanity
en masse is bound to fail because collective self-determination is a
contradiction in terms. There is no such thing as the common good, for
there is no good that is common to all. Society, collective, and public
are only convenient terms to designate individuals in the aggregate;
they are not entities — they have no bodies, minds, interests, or real
existence: A collective has no self, and is but a collection of selves who
have waived their individual powers and will to self-determination,
for what is claimed to be the interests of the majority. The price paid
for collective unity is always the subordination of the member units,
which is the antithesis of anarchy (as we understand it). The ideal Free
Society of autonomous but federated collectives that Social Anarchists
envision (The AK Press version of anarchy) differs very little from the
state capitalist reality of autonomous but interlocking corporations:
in both cases individual sovereignty is fettered and repressed so that
collective mediocrity may flourish. Beyond the fact that this federation-model constitutes one of the most boring and narrow images of what
liberation might mean that it’s possible for the human mind to conceive,
the very desire for individual difference — or uniqueness — is destined to
be held competitive and dangerous to the egalitarian (or inevitably,
hierarchical) solidarity of these federations and communes, and the
anarchist Mass utopia, if it were ever implemented (which it won’t
be), would inescapably become a reign of stagnancy, servility, and
conformity. It’s difficult to regard collectivist anarchists as anarchists at
all, since they simply want to turn over what amounts to State power to
their communes and federations and to promote party lines and group
think in the interest of a fraudulent solidarity —And woe betide anyone
who dissents from the collective plan or decision!

That this concern is not mere boogey-man scaremongering is
borne out by a critical examination of what many consider the pivotal
moment in anarchist history, the Spanish Civil War (and specifically
the practices of the falsely titled <em>anarcho-syndicalist</em> CNT, which has
been outrageously glorified in innumerable studies, and which actually
had a brief opportunity to try to implement their utopia). Regarding
syndicalist federalism, in “What is the CNT?,” Jose Peirats ominously
records that "Federation always implies freedom and self-government
of the federated bodies, but this does not mean their independence.”
And this is spelt out even more clearly in the <em>Rule Book of the CNT</em>, in
which its constitution is described. Here we are told that in the CNT “We
recognize the sovereignty of the individual, but we accept and agree
to carry out the collective mandate taken by majority decision". This
clause is reinforced by others, which state that "anarcho-syndicalism
and anarchism recognize the validity of majority decisions” and that
"the militant... is obliged to comply with majority decisions even when
they are against his own feelings"! This constitution was operative
when the CNT was a minority organization in opposition. What its
application would have meant when the CNT had taken "over the
tasks of production and distribution after the revolution” is not hard
to guess — at best, a theoretically democratic federalism; at worst, an
economic totalitarianism. In either case it would not be anarchy.

It only remains to add that the Spanish syndicalist de Santillan
saw one of the roles of the syndicalist federal economic council as
the distribution of Labor from one region to another, which gives us
a picture of the syndicalist new order that is rather different from an
anarchist vision of a liberated world. Needless to say, we’re not told
by these social saviors what would happen to Labor that refused to
be distributed according to the orders of de Santillan’s "directed and
planned socialized economy,” but it becomes pretty apparent that
the syndicalists just wanted to replace the State with an industrial
organization every bit as opposed to self sovereignty — and this
observation applies equally to the utopian schemes of the so-called
libertarian socialists and anarcho-communists, with their mechanized,
efficient picture of social perfection (essentially just another form of
the Leftist workers paradise).

If history and the record of every collectivist experiment large and
small prove anything it is the staggering— in fact insurmountable —
difficulties and complexities of such a proposed mass organization.
What happens to those individuals who don’t wish to be planned,
who don’t like the Jobs assigned to them by their fellow workers, and
who wish to exist outside the purview of the absolute power of these
workers councils? Or how about those who don’t wish to be citizens
but to be free of citizen-hood, to escape from statehood (regardless
of what it’s called), those who desire to secede from this fancied,
singular entity called society? What happens when an absolutely total
unanimity doesn’t reign in the federated pyramid of workers councils,
when separations don't magically disappear, and some individuals find
the plans and democratic decisions of others not to their liking? The
common ownership ideal of these left-anarchists would make Society
or Humanity the new proprietor, the new lord-god. And if Society is the
owner, then everyone is owned by Society and must suffer its dictation.

Anarchy is freedom, and this most assuredly includes the freedom
not to be a socialist or to live like one, and the freedom not to limit one's
identity to any social role — especially that of worker. It's the freedom
not to participate in communal activities or to share communal goals,
or to pray before the idol of Solidarity. It’s freedom not only from the
rule of the State but also from that of the tribe, village, commune, or
production syndicate. It’s the freedom to choose one's own path to
one’s own goals, to map out one's own campaign against Authority,
and, if desired, to go it alone.

Of course, anarcho-syndicalism is no longer a credible or even very
active force, and only continues to linger around anarchist circles as a
type of phantom belief, analogous to the syndrome of phantom limbs — a
limb such as an arm or leg that someone no longer possesses, yet which
still seems to be there, attached to the body, and continuing to cause
pain or distraction. But the social forecasts of the anarcho-communists
and anarcho-socialists (who, regrettably, are still with us) are actually
not substantially different, in that they all envision something akin to
this workers council model — an entirely leftist political structure, about
which anarchists ought to be embarrassed. This extended intercourse
with decayed leftist thinking is partly why anarchist theory has gone
flabby, and helps clarify why so much important anarchist history has
remained undocumented.

But anarchism, though a political or <em>anti-political</em> philosophy, is not
a doctrine, and the anarchist theoretical spectrum, because it does
(in the final analysis) stress freedom, has never become an ideology
that is pure. Many anarchists have been doctrinaire, even dogmatic,
but no single doctrine or school has ever encompassed more than a
part of anarchist thought. Consequently, anarchism has also generated
radically <em>individualist</em> currents that place the majesty of the free
individual first, foremost, and above all things — including society. Of
course, it has to be admitted that these aren't the voices that generally
appear in anarchist history books (which are in the main overshadowed
by anarcho-communist perspectives), and when they are given space it's
typically in the form of footnotes. Yet these remain some of the more
wild, undomesticated, and disreputable voices in anarchist thought, the
voices that embody the most radical qualities of the anarchist revolt —
the "heart of the blast", so to speak — and in them we catch gleams
of the elemental and barbaric will to sovereignty that characterizes
an unconquered individual. These are anarchists who don’t confuse
self rule with social reform, the dethroning of authority with planning
committee meetings, or insurgency with daydreaming. Their revolt
springs from self-interest — a conscious egoism — but they’re honest
enough to admit it, without shame and without justifications.

From an individualist perspective, to speak of an anarchist politics
is an absurdity. Politics is the science of how to organize a society,
a collectivity (or town — Polis) and anarchism, taken to its furthest
conclusions, is anti-collectivist. Anarchism is an individual way of
engaging with the world, a rebellion against what is, a declaration
of what should not be, not a prescription for what should be. The
hypothesis of an organized collectivist tomorrow presages a ferocious
struggle between the New Order and the individuals who are desirous
of preserving their autonomy. Even in the most optimistic scenario — ie,
an effort to forge a new culture based on anti-authoritarian principles —
any post-revolutionary social grouping will inevitably tend to impose
one ideological credo on its members and reignite the age-old struggle
between the individual and society. Thus, individualist anarchists have
no programme for anyone else — and quite often have no programme
even for themselves!

Most individualist anarchists also accept that what is known as
the State or government is not going to be abolished in some glorious
collective revolution and that expecting this to happen is in the same
class as expecting the oceans to turn into lemonade. They regard
clinging to this eschatological fantasy as a wasteful fixation that renders
anarchists not exceptionally different from the Christian who lives
for heaven or the Muslim who lives for paradise: a mixing of religion
(with its messianic tendencies) with social doctrine to make of anti-political aspirations and social revolt a prophetic affair — with promises
of full-measured social salvation at hand, and a millennium around the
left corner. Not only is the ideal of abolishing the State a theoretical
whimsy under present circumstances, it's also impossible to pursue any
ideal with single-minded determination without eventually becoming
enslaved to that ideal (and enslavement to ideals is slavery as much as
Is bondage to a physical master) — at which point the ideal becomes
more of an enflamed hallucination than a critical engagement with
the world as it is. If anything, in the dawn of the twenty first century,
it seems reasonable to predict that Statism will continue to escalate
on a dizzying scale and dimension, as environmental and population
pressures intensify dependency on the infrastructure of mass society.
It’s one thing to see the State exactly for what it is, to at least avoid
the disastrous error of mistaking it for a benefactor or mistaking its
witless and oppressive orders for divine commands, to demystify and
de-sanctify the State in one’s own life and creatively out manuever its
attempts at control— but it’s another matter entirely to attempt to
confront the very real power of the State with vain, meaningless chest-
thumping or to underestimate the support the State has among the
presumably discontented masses. Ideological anarchists don’t like to
hear this, but the State continues to exist, not solely by violent conquest
or deception, but because there is a demand for its services from the
sheep habituated to governance.

Individualist anarchists/conscious egoists preach no holy war
against the State because they're reflective enough to admit that they
know of no way to get rid of the State — and that the problems of the
State and organized society may, in fact, be intrinsically insoluble. If all
political rule rests ultimately on the consent of the subject masses —
and is cemented upon society by the laziness, cowardice, and stupidity
of those same masses — -then when the cataclysmic crises looming on
the planetary horizon (such as environmental and economic meltdown)
begin to occur, the masses will probably call for a new Caesar or
Hitler (as they always do) to rescue them from the system-failure
that traditional political forms are no longer capable of addressing.
Fear, bolstered by the insidious throes of habit, is the mainspring of
the Herd's every thought and action and even in the most opportune
historical moments they have failed to establish anything approximating
self-determination. This is just one of many flaws in the entire set of
assumptions regarding authoritarian culture: Master-slave dynamics
are a complex relationship between the governors and the governed,
a mutually-reinforcing feedback loop between the legislators and
the servile multitudes, inextricably bound together in an ancient and
familiar holding pattern.

Taking this all into account, conscious egoists have no firm position
on insurrection and retain tactical flexibility in the face of the realities
of power, weighing the long and short run benefits of various forms of
rebellion against the risks and costs, individually. If they lack the strength
in the moment to overthrow those forces that claim authority and/or
demand compliance, they will evade them the best way they know how,
put up with that part of it which is unavoidable, assert their sovereignty
as often as they can, pursue liberation in realms other than the political,
continually engage in cultural de-conditioning, and when all else fails take
refuge in what James Joyce described as "silence, exile, and cunning”.
Their egoistic victories come not in the form of revolutionary martyrdom,
but in the successful creation of free lives, and at times, free culture.

All society-oriented versions of anarchism carry within them the
ideological virus of utopianism, in that they posit individual liberation as
conditional on the liberation of The Masses or The People. But to make
my freedom conditional on the freedom of others is to turn me into
their servant and to deny my self-ownership in favor of a masochistic,
unattainable, altruistic ideal. By changing anarchism into a theoretical
conception of an ideal free society — instead of an individualistic
rejection of authority — the society-oriented anarchists then become
obliged to convince others that Anarchy would work and begin drawing
up diagrams for everything from anarchist trash collection to worker-owned sewage treatment plants. Moreover, in their zeal to prove
that a stateless society — one without a government as we ordinarily
recognize it — is practical, these socially preoccupied anarchists turn
into incorrigible moralists obsessed with the desire to fix some objective
standard for human behavior that will endure for all time. And, as with
all other moralists, social anarchists delude themselves by thinking
that what they wish to impose on others is “the will of the people”
or "historically inevitable" or anything other than their own personal
egoistic desires. This is not a criticism of selfishness at all, but of self-deception — and of self-defeating idealism, not self-serving realism.
Moralists — whether religious, political or humanist — are unconscious
egoists and they seek converts to their ideal conceptions, ie they
seek willing slaves and fellow believers. Individualist anarchists, by
contrast, are conscious egoists and seek allies and partners for mutually
enjoyable adventures in subversion. They see it as indisputable that no
government or ruling class could oppress anybody without the broad
support of public opinion, and to imagine that most people are longing
for the abolition of the hallowed institutions of authoritarian society is
to live in a dream world. (Even the most disgruntled members of the
populace are usually far from being anarchists.) History has shown that
the sheep who accept the authority of their shepherds have always
been the largest class, and so for individualist anarchists anarchy
becomes not a future place, but a present state of mind, an individual
denial of authority, not a future social practice. Their anarchism is not
a matter of faith and rejects the sacrificial politics of social anarchism,
which is predicated on pointless optimism, reward-less duty and the
Indefinite postponement of freedom: their anarchism is grounded in
the clarity that sovereignty is only for those who want it and that one
must comprehend and confront their own slavish conditioning before
freedom timorously ventures within their reach. Individualist anarchists
are more than willing to make use of a social revolution to further their
own adventure, but always without any illusions regarding the Herd's
atrocious track record and deep-seated fear of real freedom.

At this point is should be made clear that there’s never been an
anarchist individualist movement that has brought under one hat
such unique personalities as Josiah Warren, Thoreau, Zo D’Axa, John
Henry Mackay, James L. Walker and the countless other idiosyncratic
thinkers who all developed wildly varied visions of anarchy. As its very
name implies, individualist anarchism is a philosophy of a “plurality of
possibilities" and if it’s inconsistent at times, that very inconsistency
allows endless space for growth, diversity, and mutation. Still, no
intelligent discussion of individualist anarchism and/or conscious
egoism can occur without first grappling with Max Stirner and his
inflammatory, ground breaking work, <em>The Ego and His Own</em>, which is
responsible for not only presenting the fundamentals, but also the
implications of individualism. Highly controversial when first presented
to the world in 1844, his book became the object of much shock and
ridicule, most notably from Karl Marx and Fredrich Engels, who revealed
more about their own insecurities than anything else in their 300 pages
of “repudiation” — a hysterical diatribe comprising more pages than
Stirner’s own work. The thick and thorough expressions of Stirner’s
writing starts early in the history of the machinations of society, and
progresses with palpable passion into the most sublime workings
of society over the individual, and by the end frees the individual
from this morass. Like a grand dissociator of ideas, or a surgeon of
illusions, Stirner makes a sacrilegious broth out of all the materials of
human thought (particularly morality) and brews from them Nothing.
Your dreams? Stirner skins them alive. Your God(s)? Stirner splits this
phantasm into an infinite number of particles and hands you back a
hatful of waste. Your cobweb-spinning idealisms? Stirner tears asunder
the masks of self-deception and exposes all idealism as worship of
the non-existent. To Stirner, belief of any kind is a species of hypnosis
and he sloughs off dogma, codes, and ideology like snake-skin. The
furious energy of Stirner’s anti-metaphysical assault is both savage
and interrogative in its impact: Unsentimental, heretical, and liberatory
beyond what his contemporaries could dream of or stomach, Stirner
was seemingly forgotten before re-introduction to the Americas by the
anarchist Benjamin Tucker in 1907. (Tucker received considerable help
in this endeavor from anarchist poet John Henry Mackay, the egoist
James L. Walker, and the translator Steven T. Byington.) Nothing
more and nothing less is postulated within <em>The Ego and His Own</em> than
the absolute sovereignty of the individual in the face of all attempts
at his/her weakening and suppression: by the "spooks" and the loose
screws in the human brain along with all external powers that want
to subjugate the unique individual under the guise of law. To the first,
negative section of his critique, the criticism of Man, Stirner counters
the more positive second section, his "I”. Here he first clears up the
falsely understood concept of freedom, which cannot be given, but
must be taken and then describes the "unique one": his power with
regard to the State and society, this power that laughs at law as a
phantasm; his intercourse with the world, which consists in his using
it; and his self-enjoyment, which leads to uniqueness, to which the I
as I develops. To Utopians, one of the most threatening qualities of
Stirner’s negation is that he has no interest in supplying a substitute
structure for that which he seeks to terminate. (It’s difficult for the
idealistmindto grasp the concept of negation for negation’s sake, or to
appreciate Stirner's radical negation as at once a splendid affirmation —
of free life!) More alarmingly, Stirner divulges the selfish and hollow
foundation of all humanitarian movements — the predatory, greedy,
power-craving, egoistic motives that hide behind the ideological mask
of social service.

Between the publishing of <em>The Ego and His Own</em> and Stirner’s re-discovery by John Henry Mackay and Benjamin R. Tucker, fatefully
enough, the Russian Nihilist movement began and Nietzsche’s
blasphemous proclamations made their earth-shaking appearance
in Europe, initiating a new dawn for individualism and setting the
stage for Stirner’s return. There is even debate as to Stirner’s possible
influence on Nietzsche. Although no conclusion has come of this
exploration, it speaks to the power and potency of Stirner’s Luciferean
intellect that some consider him a precursor to one of the most pitiless
iconoclasts of all time. While socialist and syndicalist movements such
as the IWW and the Bolsheviks gained traction in the early twentieth
century, the momentum and power of individualist anarchist thought
found a home most notably within the Italian, French, and Spanish
anarchist milieus. They, along with Stirner, are the progenitors of our
legacy today and established the first fruitful era of Egoist practice.
They are still heretical, since most proclaimed anarchists could not
conceive of putting their individual life expression above that of their
chosen social causes. The concept of amorality scares average people
like a thought virus, and most of those exposed to the more radical
strains of Individualist thought react as if the devil himself had tabled
a proposition for their own freedom. Yet those in the top echelons of
society (finance capitalists, for instance) wield power driven fully by
their amoral individual desires, and count on the masses constraining
themselves with myriad social regulations and ethics — what Nietzsche
referred to as "slave moralities". These ruthlessly skilled exploiters
are certainly conscious egoists and in a sense, more daring than most
anarchists, since they effectively put themselves above government,
not just verbally like a mass of whining, morally indignant slaves. As
the State and the ruling class directly diminish the enjoyment of my
existence, my own egoistic desire is to see them put effectively out of
my way. But it isn't my attributes and limited power that are a danger
to the State or Society, it's the multiplication of my attributes should
they permeate those of like mind. The revolutionary value of Egoism is
that it removes all taboos or selfishness and the acquisition of personal
power, and smashes the mental chains of slave morality. The rules and
laws of society were made to fetter conquered vassals and fools — but
the conscious egoist knows that they are under no obligation to obey
anything or anyone. Think of the implications of unbound individual
expression and power countering the established authorities! If
the masses were to manifest their conscious egoism, and become
ungovernable individuals who seize and keep all that their power
permits them to take, these established authorities could not handle or
control people anymore: a union of bold, determined beings, animated
by clear-sighted self interest, who won't succumb to any master,
corporeal or so-called divine, is a force that any governing agency
would have a hard time vanquishing. With illusory social obligations laid
bare and broken behind us, the question would no longer be whether
to embrace Egoism, but what personal fears must we jettison to begin
the individualist journey post-haste? To slash the veils of illusion that
countless generations of social conditioning have instilled in us, to
strike down the spooks (within and without) that promise freedom
but deliver yet more quandaries, is the exact antidote needed to the
violently enforced Sisyphusian nightmare of culture and civilization
that keeps us as in thrall to the delusion of social identification (not to
mention the myth of social progress).

Social anarchists have typically decried this type of egoist social
analysis as "bourgeois individualism,” confident that their use of the
dreaded word "bourgeois" is sufficient to convince the faithful to think
no further. Anarchist individualists are not likely to lose any sleep over
being labeled so, but the use of the term in such a way is indicative
of social anarchist argumentation, which is almost always by way of
morality and intimidation rather than independent analysis. Kropotkin,
commenting on individualist anarchism in America in his oft-quoted
contribution to the Encyclopedia Brittanica, wrote:

<blockquote>
Those who profess it ....they are chiefly “intellectuals”...
soon realize that the individualism they so
highly praise is not attainable by individual efforts,
and either abandon the ranks of the Anarchists,
and are driven into the liberal individualism of the
classical economists, or they retire into a sort of
Epicurean a-moralism, or super-man-theory, similar
to that of Stirner or Nietzsche...

<div class="text-right text-normal">
<em>Encyclopedia Brittanica</em>, 11th edition,<br>
Volume i, pp 914-916
</div>
</blockquote>

In this encyclopedia entry Kropotkin, as usual, defines anarchism
as a secular variant of the Christian Heaven and indulges in his classic
populist mystifications about the masses. Despite an attempt to be
objective in his presentation, he singles out Stirner and even the tepid
Benjamin Tucker as villains whose ideas encourage “amoralism" and
"super-man-theory". Somewhat incongruously, he then instances the
works of Nietzsche as being among those "full of ideas which show
how closely anarchism is interwoven with the work that is going on in
modern thought”. But just how close is "closely" to this egalitarian true
believer and chronic optimist? It’s not at all surprising that Kropotkin,
the humanist, moralist, and communist par excellence, makes Stirner his
arch-villain. After all, <em>The Ego and His Own</em> is not only the most outspoken
exposition of amoralism in the history of philosophy, but also one of
the most powerful vindications of individualism ever written — in some
ways, the ultimate encouragement to self liberation and one without a
suggested social replacement for what is to be overthrown — and none
of these things would be to the stunted tastes of Kropotkin and his pious,
collectivist followers.

Yet many of Kropotkin's contemporaries from the “Heroic Age
of Anarchism", like Emma Goldman, never forgot the primacy of the
individual and understood the supreme relevance of both Stirner and
Nietzsche to anarchist thought, as evidenced by the following passage:

<blockquote>
The most disheartening tendency common among
readers is to tear out one sentence from a work, as a
criterion of the writer's ideas or personality. Friedrich
Nietzsche, for instance, is decried as a hater of the
weak because he believed in the Ubermensch. It does
not occur to the shallow interpreters of that giant
mind that this vision of the Ubermensch also called
for a state of society which will not give birth to a
race of weaklings and slaves.
<br><br>
It is the same narrow attitude which sees in Max
Stirner naught but the apostle of the theory “each
for himself, the devil take the hind one.” That
Stirner’s individualism contains the greatest social
possibilities is utterly ignored. Yet, it is nevertheless
true that if society is ever to become free, it will be
so through liberated individuals, whose free efforts
make society.
<br>

</blockquote>

Since Emma Goldman wrote these words, it's been amply
demonstrated that both the feeble namby-pambyism of the “save the
world” anarchist and the collectivist revolutionary models of social
change have failed to deliver the goods. This shows an observant, non-
ideological person that this orientation does not work. In the search for
the ultimate sacrifice, selflessness for the Common Good has denied the
basic truth of human self-interest, and is both hopelessly naive about
human nature and hermetically sealed against all realistic feedback
regarding the psychology of masses. The Kropotkinist dream of full
agreement and peaceful fraternity among people denies the irrefutable
fact of differentiation, and is founded on the seductive but malignant
politico-ethical principles of socialism (itself an offspring of Christianity).
As long as anarchists remain preoccupied with saving The Masses (even
In spite of themselves), then anarchists will curtail their own evolution
and self-empowerment and be herded into an intellectual fog. (This
morbid, pathological over-identification with large collectives probably
helps explain Kropotkin’s later appalling support for World War I.)

If all are bound to one another by some imaginary social contract and
if the majority elect to jump into the lake (of fire), then I am doomed
unless I can emancipate myself from the crazed lemming herd before it's
too late to save my own astoundingly precious life. Using swimming as an
analogy: the overburdened individual sinks, like the group that, tied to one
another, drags each other down, dooming alt! The self-owning individual
is of the open spaces — intrepid, recalcitrant, nimble, spontaneous, and
agile — and able to raise his or her self above the weight and sheer gravity
of the Masses and their self-defeating belief systems, precisely because s/he
is unencumbered with delusional social theorems.

If anarchists (who claim no gods, no masters) were to look at any
social movement and the assumed collectivist orientation with open
eyes, we would easily find the inherent duplicity of motives that are veiled
and hidden under the most grandiloquent and idealistic principles —
and the bombs of egoistic purpose that are carefully hidden in all the
fine silks of utopian promises. While many may agree intellectually with
this assessment, understanding is not entirely an intellectual process
and clearing the spooks of collectivist social responsibility requires a
hard edge of criticism — it requires that we give total attention to the
structure of our conditioning, to the inherited psychological patterns
that encourage us to identify with something outside ourselves —
whether it be the State, an ideology, or Society. As Stirner constantly
does, we must get behind the nature of these philosophical institutions
and assumptions; we must clear the phantom beliefs of what the social
being is, and start at the most neglected and maligned truth: l am the
only master.

Individualist anarchism in the United States was most notably
expounded in the pages of Benjamin R. Tucker’s journal Liberty,
which was published from 1881 to 1908. Tucker and his associates —
all capable writers and thinkers — attempted to forge individualist
anarchism into a coherent system through an ill-conceived fusion of
Proudhon’s economic theories and Max Stirner’s uncompromising
egoism. In the end, Tucker’s efforts to reconcile the utopianism of
Proudhon and the individualist amoralism of Stirner resulted in neither
fish nor fowl, but mostly in confusion (for example, Tucker's support
for private police and private courts to combat and punish theft) and
in unconvincing visions of a future harmonious society held together
by the principles of what Tucker called "equal liberty.” Still, Tucker did
two very important things to help the development of individualist
thought: 1) As already stated, he published the first English translation
of Stirner’s incendiary masterpiece <em>The Ego and His Own</em> and 2) he
allowed the pages of his widely-read journal Liberty to serve as an
uncensored forum for the discussion of egoist perspectives on power,
politics, and self-determination. Although we have no desire to dwell
excessively on Tucker’s overly idealistic theories in this anthology, it
would be disingenuous to ignore either him or the vibrant milieu that
formed around his ideas — a milieu that produced some formidable
egoist thinkers like James L. Walker, John Beverley Robinson, and John
Badcock, Jr.

The primary focus of this anthology, however, is to explore the
development of anarchist individualism in Europe and the multifarious
constructions and applications of Stirner's ideas by anarchists in Italy,
Spain, France, and England. This collection is by no means comprehensive,
owing primarily to the fact that so many core texts have yet to be
translated into English. (For example, Enzo Martucci’s <em>The Banner of
the Antichrist</em>; Miguel Gimenez Igualada's extensive treatise on Stirner
from 1956; the writings of BicSfilo Pandasta — Columbian Stirnerite,
adventurerand vagabond; the Russian anarchist Lev Chernyi's 1907 book
<em>Associational Anarchism</em>, in which he advocated the "free association of
independent individuals.”)

Other important individuals unrepresented in this collection for
similar reasons; Ixigrec, the French anarchist science-fiction writer,
comrade of E. Armand, and radical interpreter of the Marquis de
Sade; Rirette Maitrejean, who wrote extensively on anarcha-feminist
and free love subjects for the French individualist anarchist magazine
<em>L'Anarchie</em>, and who went on trial in the 1920s for alleged participation
in the illegalist activities of the Bonnot Gang; Domenico Pastorello,
the Italian polyglot and popularizer of Esperanto, who advocated an
ascetic lifestyle of self-sufficiency as a solution to economic slaveiy;
The Brazilian individualist anarchist Maria Lacerda de Moura who wrote
for the Spanish individualist anarchist magazine <em>Al Margen</em> alongside
Miguel Gimenez Igualada; Octave Mirbeau, "the Ravachol of modem
literature”, author of <em>The Torture Garden</em> and the timeless abstentionist
pamphlet Voters Strike!; Federico Urales, an important Spanish
individualist anarchist who edited the journal <em>La Revista Blanca</em> and was
highly critical of the anarcho-syndicalism in his time (he viewed it as
plagued by excessive bureaucracy that tended towards reformism),
and Adolf Brand, German individualist anarchist writer, comrade of
John Henry Mackay, editor of the periodical <em>Der Eigene</em> (1896-1931)
and pioneering campaigner for the acceptance of male bisexuality and
homosexuality. The list just goes on and on.

The individualist anarchist press has also had a fertile life (with
points of abandonment followed by periods of resurgence) and a
rich, innovative publishing history — one abounding with variety,
local flavor and an emancipatory non conformism towards ready-
made anarchist dogma and programs. Some of the more noteworthy
examples are Enrico Arrigoni's journal <em>Erisia</em>, which unleashed nine
issues between 1928-1928 that anarchist historian Paul Avrich describes
as "remarkable". Then there are the French individualist papers, which
are almost too numerous to catalogue, but loosely start with <em>Autonomie
Individuelle</em> (1887 to 1888) giving birth to a genealogy that continues
to proliferate in our day. The Spanish individualist milieu of the 1920s
and 1930s is just as impressive, producing confident, multihued journals
like <em>L'Individualista</em>, <em>La Idea Libre</em>, <em>La revista blanca</em>, <em>Etica</em>, <em>Iniciales</em>, <em>Al
margen</em>, <em>Estudios</em>, <em>El Unico</em>, and <em>Nosotros</em>. Who knows what illuminating
gems lie buried in the yellowing pages of these lively texts, waiting to
be unearthed, translated, and discussed again! Catalan historian Xavier
Diez, who recently completed a wide-ranging survey of the Spanish
individualist anarchist press before and during the Civil War period,
summarized the basic positions of this tendency as follows:

<blockquote>
under its iconoclastic, anti-intellectual, antitheist
run, which goes against all sacralized ideas or
values it entailed, a philosophy of life took shape
which could be considered a reaction against the
sacred gods of capitalist society. Against the idea of
the nation, it opposed its internationalism. Against
the exaltation of authority embodied in the military
institution, it opposed its antimilitarism. Against
the concept of industrial civilization, it opposed its
naturist vision.
</blockquote>

Unfortunately, access to this valuable heritage of individualist ideas
was not (yet) available to us as we were assembling this anthology,
though we did have the lucky break of coming into a windfall of
dynamic English-language Individualist and Egoist papers, publications
containing a wide range of heretical views operating outside and against
orthodox anarchism. The publications that we consumed most ardently
were <em>The Storm! A Journal For Free Spirits</em>, <em>Minus One: An Individualist
Review Egoist, and Ego</em>, supplemented by a smattering of translated
texts that fortuitously materialized when needed most. All of these
journals were driven by an utter disrespect for the alleged unity or
sanctity of the anarchist movement. They all articulate an independence
from, and refusal of, the altruistic idealisms and socialist ethics (which
are really Christian ethics) that have infested anarchist thought. They
all introduce new approaches and philosophic concerns and help to
move anti-authoritarian consciousness in a dangerous direction again.
S.E. Parker, whose writing features prominently in this compilation,
was a British individualist anarchist who, from 1963 to 1993, edited
three of the journals just cited — <em>Minus One, Egoist, and Ego</em> — all urgent,
vehemently individualist periodicals that assail the complacency of
anarchist group think and disrupt the placid reliance on morality as a
means of justifying anarchy. Parker eventually drove a wedge between
egoism proper and anarchism — at least in his own life — repudiating
anarchism as a self-renunciating, humanist church. In one of his last
published articles, Parker found himself agreeing with Dora Marsden
(«»n important early twentieth-century British egoist, whose writings
Parker helped rescue from obscurity), who argued that moralistic
anarchism is merely continuing the work of religion under a new guise.
Parker describes his "loss of faith" in the article "Archists, Anarchists
and Egoists" (which is Appendix A in this volume). He arrived at these
conclusions after forty-plus years of wrestling with the implications of
anarchism and egoism. Regardless of whether one agrees with Parker's
verdict or not, it shouldn’t be too frightening to look at, and if it is then
you probably shouldn’t be reading this book; As a philosophical weapon,
anarchist thought has become dull, has lost its once-lethal edge and
become encrusted with leftist cliches. One of the purposes In compiling
these outsider voices is to help relieve anti-authoritarians of the burden
of carrying the impossible load of universal emancipation (this leftist
ideal of herd-life that undermines our individual strength) and to help
re awaken the slumbering dragon of insurrectionary egoism. These are
the voices of uncompromising individualists, to whom no topic is taboo
or off-limits, voices that have stayed obscure until now, but for which
the myriad complexities of our current era provide an excellent context
for a re-appearance.

What ultimately emerges from these writings is a vision of anarchy
that is non-utopian, non-idealist, and decidedly non-leftist, a vision of
anarchy that could accurately be described as anti-social, or at least,
<em>socially pessimistic</em>. Those readers who would turn to the writers in this
collection for the exact details of a reconstructed society will search in
vain, for their concern is the rebirth of the individual as a separate entity —
unsmothered by the claims of any nation, State or society. Any sketches
of an anarchistic future they offer are apparent only by inference. Their
ideas will resonate most strongly with those defiant, unconquered
individuals who are only interested in reconstructing themselves — the
free spirits who are resolved to live outside the structures of control
as far as they possibly can, relying on their own psychic resources and
experiencing liberation on a personal level even as the whole world
slides in horror down a bottomless pit. Stripped of all fantastic figures of
speech and fruitless will-o-the-wisp schemes for social betterment, the
assertion of individual sovereignty by word and deed is the only method
and only message of these iconoclastic minds who choose to label their
personal rejection of all authority as <em>individualist</em>.
